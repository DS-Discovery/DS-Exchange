  <p><i><u>In order to receiving a passing grade:</u></i></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Students are expected to commit 6-12 hours per week to their research project (the exact time commitment expected should be confirmed with the project partner). 1 unit of academic credit is available for every 3 hours of work per week. See below for instructions regarding enrollment information.
    </li>
    <li>All student teams are required to submit a Mid-Term Progress Report (this will be sent to you as a Google Form to fill out)and a Final Presentation during reading week. 
    </li>
    <li>Students will be required to respond to 4 short surveys throughout the semester (beginning of the semester, halfway through the semester, before reading week, after the semester).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>A number of resources are available to support Discovery teams, including graduate student mentors, working groups, pre-recorded workshops, peer consultants and cloud computing credits. We encourage each student to engage at least one time with each resource in the first 4 weeks of your project.
  </p>

  <h5>Enrollment Information</h5>
  <p><b>Academic Credit</b>: If you accept an offer with a Discovery project you will be invited to enroll in a section of Data 198 (one unit is available for every 3 hours of work you do). More details on receiving  credit will come after the application deadline.</p>
