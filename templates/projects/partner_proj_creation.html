<h3>DS Discovery Project Application</h3>

    <p>Discovery connects undergraduates with hands-on, team-based opportunities in cutting-edge data research projects at UC Berkeley,
    government agencies, community groups, and entrepreneurial ventures. Through partnership with Discovery, project partners will
    have the opportunity to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase your capacity to take on data-centric projects, at any level of complexity</li>
      <li>Collaborate with UC Berkeleyâ€™s world-class data science students</li>
      <li>Create cutting edge machine learning, neural network, and AI algorithms to get new insights and tangible results from your data science projects</li>
      <li>Rely on an infrastructure of technical and project management support for your student team</li>
      <li>Join our network of professors, graduate and undergraduate students, and past project partners such as NASA, UCSF, Creative Commons, BART and more.</li>
      <li>Access free cloud computing and data storage resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Discovery is dedicated to providing top-notch data science capacity to our project partners while also fostering a unique learning environment for our students.
        Students are expected to have a single project that they can work on through the duration of their engagement with the project partner. Discovery student
        researchers are not interns that can be assigned tasks ad hoc throughout the semester, though it is expected that research goals might shift occasionally.
        <br><br>Applications will be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis through January 8th, 2021. If accepted into the program, Discovery projects will receive
        student applications for review on January 25th. Project partners are responsible for interviewing and selecting the students they would like to work with.
        We will be in touch throughout the process to guide and support project partners as you form your Discovery teams!<br><br>For specific inquiries about our program
