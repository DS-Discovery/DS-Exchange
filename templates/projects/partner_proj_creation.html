<h3>DS Discovery Project Application</h3>

    <p>Discovery connects undergraduates with hands-on, team-based opportunities in cutting-edge data research projects at UC Berkeley,
    government agencies, community groups, and entrepreneurial ventures. Through partnership with Discovery, project partners will
    have the opportunity to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase your capacity to take on data-centric projects, at any level of complexity</li>
      <li>Collaborate with UC Berkeleyâ€™s world-class data science students</li>
      <li>Create cutting edge machine learning, neural network, and AI algorithms to get new insights and tangible results from your data science projects</li>
      <li>Rely on an infrastructure of technical and project management support for your student team</li>
      <li>Join our network of professors, graduate and undergraduate students, and past project partners such as NASA, UCSF, Creative Commons, BART and more.</li>
      <li>Access free cloud computing and data storage resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Discovery is dedicated to providing top-notch data science capacity to our project partners while also fostering a unique learning environment for our students.
        Students are expected to have a single project that they can work on through the duration of their engagement with the project partner. Discovery student
        researchers are not interns that can be assigned tasks ad hoc throughout the semester, though it is expected that research goals might shift occasionally.
        <br><br>Applications will be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis through January 8th, 2021. If accepted into the program, Discovery projects will receive
        student applications for review on January 25th. Project partners are responsible for interviewing and selecting the students they would like to work with.
        We will be in touch throughout the process to guide and support project partners as you form your Discovery teams!<br><br>For specific inquiries about our program
        email <a href="mailto:ds-discovery@berkeley.edu", target="_blank">ds-discovery@berkeley.edu</a>.<br><br>To learn more about the program visit

                <p style="font-size:12px;">Keep in mind you will have 12 working weeks in a semester with your Discovery Student Team.
                    We understand that over the course of the semester, projects may evolve or change, and that's okay!
                    Please provide a rough timeline estimating what you think would be the best and most feasible progression of your project.
                    An example breakdown would look like: Phase 1 (Week 1-3): Cleaning the Data; Phase 2 (Week 4-5): Organize the data into a queryable relational database;
                Phase 3 (Week 6-10): Prototype and refine a a front-end mock up that allows users to interact with the database.</p>

                    Discovery requires you to meet with your student team atleast once a week), breakdown of daily/weekly recurring student

                <p style="font-size:12px;">HCE collaborates with the Discovery program by placing a Research Intern from the HCE team on Discovery teams as a participant/observer.
                    The Research Intern will be responsible for identifying HCE issues in the Discovery Team's work and communicating them to project members.
                    The Intern will keep a detailed journal of ethnographic observations about the Discovery Team's work, will be responsible for researching the social contexts of
                    the Team's research project, and will use their findings to produce a curricular intervention in the form of a case study for the new Data Science Ethos Lifecycle.
                    This Lifecycle may then be developed to help teach future Discovery students about the Human Contexts and Ethics of data science research. Although they are not
                    expected to do the same technical work as other Discovery students (due to the quantity of work they , the Research Intern will be considered a member of your team.
                    They will participate in all meetings and offer feedback and input on research design decisions from an HCE perspective. The student will be supervised simultaneously
                    by Professor Ari Edmundson as part of a parallel research seminar.</p>
