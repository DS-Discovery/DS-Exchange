These sheriffs resist any form of gun control, believe that they have the power to essentially nullify federal law by not enforcing laws they do not agree with, and they believe that the county sheriff is the highest official in the country. They are not regionally contained. Over 550 sheriffs opted into this ideology during Obama's administration, and over 250 of those sheriffs are currently in office. These sheriffs are on ballots and in offices all over the country from Florida and Texas to New York and Massachusetts. While the sheriffs began making headlines during the Obama presidency, reacting to any perceived threat to guns, throughout his campaign and now into his presidency, Trump has placed a strong emphasis on “law and order,” empowering and emboldening these sheriffs. The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA) is the largest network of these individuals. Founded by former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, the CSPOA is a sister organization to The Oath Keepers. The CSPOA does not have an official published membership list as of 2017, but they did send out a survey to sheriffs across the country to gauge their opinions of CSPOA’s positions.

At this time, the California Registry of Greater California (CRGC) is looking for support to implement the project in a sustainable way that offers a permanent, well-integrated communication solution in support of bladder cancer patients, and the information their physicians receive.

This project will use natural language processing on electronic pathology records to identify reports that are missing critical diagnostic information.  Once those reports are identified, a communicator tool will be developed to improve the quality of information available to physicians treating cancer patients and saving hundreds of lives in California patients who are disproportionately of African American, South Asian, Japanese, and non-Hispanic White backgrounds living in the Bay Area.

This project delivers a previously unimaginable benefit to cancer patients—applying natural language processing to evaluate tumor tissue excised with and without muscle tissue, supporting patient care, and utilizing ai to compare actual pathology reports with industry standards.  The project can immediately achieve a reduction in cancer mortality .


We can apply the technology to the incoming feed of electronic pathology reports, and use the results to convey a signal about the completeness of the pathology on which treatment and care depends. The technology will support a real-time, efficient message which will save lives.  Physicians will be able to use validated, actionable information from the state-mandated cancer registry with the same diligence they use to report individual cancer data to support surveillance, cancer control, and the reduction of the cancer burden."

The land-grant university movement brought the ideals of equality and opportunity to (white, male) Americans by removing geographic and class barriers to university education—while also serving U.S. settler colonial interests via accumulation and redistribution of Indigenous lands. Indeed, this inherent paradox has shaped the land-grant experiment since its beginning. On one hand, land-grant universities have provided high-quality, relatively affordable public education to countless Americans; on the other hand, their very structure has always privileged certain citizens while excluding others. (Note that UC Berkeley was established as the first land-grant university in the western U.S.) 

Simultaneously, inequities pervade the U.S. food system. In the last decade many land-grant universities have turned a reflexive lens on the fact that their institutions marginalize certain community members. They have begun to ask how inequities within the land-grant trifold mission of research, extension services, and education perpetuate food systems injustices in the U.S. more broadly. My research responds to these nascent visible efforts by leading agricultural universities to address structural inequality by examining how land-grant’s use pedagogical practices to improve equity and inclusion outcomes. Coursework descriptions offer a key insight into the pedagogical methods and types of food systems topics in use at land-grant universities. This project aims to create the first comprehensive database of coursework content at all 112 land-grant institutions. This database will be the first effort in the U.S. to 1) track all recent food and agriculture classes across the land-grant system, and 2) specifically identify pedagogical methods and equity-centered content. Through content analysis of land-grant university coursework this project seeks to answer the following questions: 
• Which land-grant universities—and how many—currently offer courses that 1) utilize critical pedagogical methods, and/or 2) explicitly discuss food systems equity as part of their curriculum? 
• Does the offering of critical, equity-oriented curriculum correspond to the institutions who have put forth diversity, equity, and inclusion statements and roadmaps?

The data steps are:
1) Systematically identify the online course catalogues for all 112 land-grant universities. 2) Create a broad list of keywords that identify the presence of food systems content, equity/justice content, and pedagogical approaches. 3) Use Python to web-scrape titles and descriptions of food and agricultural coursework across disciplines. 4) Manually review Python outputs and clean data as necessary. 5) Quantify the presence of various keywords in association with each land-grant. 6) Analyze data for patterns, differences, and meanings. 

The role of the Data Science Discovery Project students will be to build the Python code for performing the web-scraping. The tentative steps are: 1) Review the list of websites to broadly categorize classifications. 2) Create and test templates for scraping each type of website classification. 3) Feed the keywords in to the scraper to produce initial data.","What inspires and motivates you to work on this particular project, which sits at the intersection of education, food justice, and data science? ","1) Review the list of websites to broadly categorize classifications. 2) Create and test templates for scraping each type of website classification. 3) Feed the keywords in to the scraper to produce initial data.

We will thoughtfully establish together a team culture that values each member’s contribution.

Asian and Chinese Stock Markets) obtained from previous scholars in the same field, on other Chinese boards (such as ChiNext). Therefore, project success would be able to be summarized in an abstract similar to the papers, with specific statements. 
- The project will be successful if we are able to accomplish a concise conclusion from our analysis and extend the results from previous papers to considering new trading strategies applicable to STIB (due to the different structure and policies imposed on STIB but not the other stock boards).
 
(2) Holistic success as a project for students:
- Be able to demonstrate increased understanding of the general investment environment in China, especially relevant laws and regulations regarding IPOs on the Sci-Tech Innovation Board.
- Practice foundational data-mining and financial data analytics concepts through modeling on real datasets; and be able to express our ideas in code more fluently.
