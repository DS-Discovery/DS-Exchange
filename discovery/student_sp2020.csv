Initially coming into Berkeley, I planned to be an applied math major, but decided to take Data 8 due to an interest in coding although I have no prior experience other than CS10. After taking Data 8, I realized I wanted to major in Data Science because I believe that this major applies beyond the realm of coding and can be applied to so many more fields in order to improve our society.I wish to get involved within the Division of Data Science to apply Data Science in ways that would help the common good of society. The realm of coding can go beyond the computer screen to improve our society. This could range from making open source projects that improves government services to communities to teaching coding to underserved communities. I have always thought that coding was something impersonal and a tool to make money. Yet I was unaware that coding could be so much more and bring social change; a change that is at the hands of the programmer to creatively make something for a better cause. For example an important cause would be giving access to resources for young learners who would not necessarily be exposed to coding in their community. I did not know what coding was until the end of my senior year in high school, so introducing and empowering young men and women to explore the world of coding is crucial for a diverse tech community. Not everyone has the same resources or experiences with coding and technology, which is why making technology more accessible and welcoming is important if we want to apply programming for social good.","As a member of the Discovery Research team, I wish to become more affiliated with the major and hope to learn through this experience which field I can apply Data Science to and the means of doing so. I want to gain more experience in working with teams to complete technical and general projects related to Data Science.  Data Scholars Pathways has shown more the support and knowledge needed to lead a Data Science track. I wish to be part of a community that strives to promote Data Science to individuals who would have not otherwise have knowledge or access to Data Science in their own communities.",My approach to teamwork includes having multiple meetings in which we discuss which parts of the assignment we will contribute and have weekly meetings in order to discuss our improvements and connect our discoveries together.,Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"Homelessness is an important issue that is not being addressed enough, possibly due to it widely affecting minorities. It has hit close to home since I live in a low socio-economic community, Santa Ana, in which homelessness is at an all time high and the displacement of homelessness is very real yet widely ignored. Growing up, I have seen many houseless individuals placed by the Santa Ana River only to find them suddenly disappear as they have been displaced from this site. The displacement, lack of resources, and initiative of Santa Ana has been inadequate in its effectiveness within my community. There is a push from economically stable communities to displace homelessness out of their communities as they seek to distance themselves from this issue without realizing that their behavior is further perpetuating this cycle of homelessness. I feel as if this project can help address the vulnerability that houseless individuals face as policy is criminalizing and working against them. Policy should be changed to provide support to these individuals rather than further displacing them from existing communities.
",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"
The research done by the D-Lab regarding the detection of hate speech online has fueled an interest in studying today's hate speech lexicon since my alma mater has recently surfaced on the matter of hate speech. Hate speech and free speech has always been widely debated and researching the opposite perspective of inclusive speech would help make the cyberspace community more welcoming. In today's divided political age, we seek to identify what offends us and further segregates us rather than seeking to find what brings us together.

I have always thought that coding was something impersonal and a tool to make money. Yet I was unaware that coding could be so much more and bring social change; a change that is at the hands of the programmer to creatively make something for a better cause. Growing up in a low-socio economic community like Santa Ana, I have seen the lack of civic participation because of alienation sentiments and lack of interest that my community has in politics.

I was a crazy soccer and basketball fan from an early age. Unlike any other kid I know, I’ve loved to process the raw data to reach my own conclusion instead of getting processed information. While judging a player’s performance, I would neither use my general opinion after I’ve watched the game nor directly compare goals or assists. I would delve deep and look at the chances he missed and compare the performance of his teammates when he was playing and when he wasn’t. This obsession with getting the real picture out of messy data has trained me as a lonely sports data analyst while watching the games. My love in sports and data sometimes drive me to stare on games and player statistics for hours.","As Discovery Research could be my first college research, I hope to gain a lot from it. After learning Mathematics in most part of my life and computer science for several years, I really hope to implement my knowledge and do some projects directly related to computer science or data science. Also, it is always cool to meet those with similar interests with me. It will be fantastic to share my ideas with other stem majors and learn from other people probably having more experience than me. I am so passionate about data science after I began my undergraduate study. I am sometimes even annoyed by not having enough knowledge to crack problems I want to solve. While in research team, I will be willing to learn from basic knowledge that I need for a successful research including not only technical skills but also ability to communicate and cooperate. ","I have experience of playing different roles in different groups from leader to technical supports. I always try my best to encourage my teammates and create a harmonic and cheering environment in the team. Only in that way can a team be efficient. As the leader of my high school science team, I gained a lot of experience to work well in a team. Together with five classmates, I designed and established an animal lab and conducted a research on the effect of electromagnetic wave on the growth of lab mice. My main responsibilities vary from negotiator with academic director, coordinator for big events, supervisor for experiments to cheerleader while our team is facing difficulties. More specifically, I had to coordinate the duty schedule, fill up a hole if someone really couldn’t make it and talk people out of quitting the team.

Instead, we just have raw data sets and are open to figure out what we can do with the data. I think that process could also be an important and interesting part of data science research that I hope to experience. ",Data for Social Good,"I did an E-bike Safety Research in high school. I chose this topic because I hoped to turn my interests in data science into something that can influence people around me. With nearly the same motivation, I choose this research related to social good without hesitation. Also, in my past researches, I’ve encountered many problems but lacked the specialized techniques to tackle. For example, I am looking forward to learning new types of regression model to improve the logistic model that I’ve been relying on. I also hope to gain more insight on processing raw data and analyzing skewness or other hidden patterns. Having spent a tremendous amount of time on this project, my mind will not be easily settled.

I love to read in my free time and play the occasional video game. My favorite genre of book to read would most definitely have to be fantasy because of the beautiful and fantastical worlds that the authors can build. This ties in with video games because the worlds that certain games are set in can be very magical with endless possibilities. It is safe to say that I have a very active imagination and I love to think about how technology can help reach the seemingly impossible goals. ,"I would love to gain experience in applying the knowledge I've obtained in my classes to projects. It is definitely difficult to be accepted into a research position or an internship when I have little to no experience even when including my class projects. I also have no idea what exactly I would apply data science to. I'm always asked, ""What are you interested in?"" The answer to that is, ""Many things sound interesting and I love learning but school takes up so much time."" I realize that I have a lot of resources at my disposal, but I am not utilizing them because it's hard to pinpoint one thing to start on. There are always excuses to not do something and I believe participating in Discovery Research can allow me to step outside my comfort zone and start coming up with reasons for why I should do something. Furthermore, I would love to work on something interesting and possibly discover something I'm passionate about.","I believe that teamwork is built upon communication and the want and willingness to move the project forward. My communication style is very direct and I believe in confrontation of problems. Sometimes if the small things are not resolved, they can lead to bigger problems and issues in the long run. Even if the problem is me, in that I'm confused, stuck or lost, I believe in communicating it. In my first semester at UC Berkeley I was a part of the general members of Data Science Society. I joined a team of three other like-minded people who wanted to work on a data science project. We were very enthusiastic at first and we came up with a timeline for which we would find the data, clean the data, etc. However, this was my first semester and I had none of the skills or experience needed to participate in this project. I was not clear about my lack of experience and I was embarrassed to even say that I didn't know what ""cleaning the data"" meant. We ended up abandoning the project later on in the semester. This experience made me realize that I need to be upfront with what skills I don't have because otherwise the potential I have to help the team in any sort of way will just be lost. ",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"I'm taking a demography class this semester and it became clear to me that education plays an enormous role in mortality, fertility, who you marry, etc. Previous to applying for this program I would have never even known the UC Berkeley is a land-grant university. I did a little bit of searching online about Berkeley and its land-grant university roots. In 2013, Carli Baker published a piece on the DailyCal calling for more opportunity to learn about agriculture. From her piece it seems that the Student Organic Gardening Association is the main source of education for urban agriculture. I would love to look into how food inequality in these land-grant universities translate into the larger U.S. society. Since education plays such a big part in the important aspects of our lives, this project is something that I would be very interested in pursuing. The motivation for me to work on this project is that I want to be able to make an impact whilst gaining the necessary skills to fully understand and deploy aspects of this project. I believe that being able to collect the data and being involved from the very start can be beneficial to really understanding the data. ",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"This project is interesting because a lot of sites have now implemented ways to detect hate speech and remove them including user reporting and manual removal. Therefore, I would be interested to see how that would affect this data. Furthermore, I am curious about how this project can help in facilitating better conversations and more inclusive communities online. The importance of recognizing that there are many different types of comments, language, and behavior can contribute to the overall wellness in the cyberspace. Also, I can definitely see the impact that this project would bring to the online community which is so prevalent nowadays and will be even more so in the future. I'm also very interested in being included in the process from start to finish of a project such as this one. From hand-labeling data to applying machine-learning algorithms, I am very excited to see the outcome. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I am prepared to follow all the required data security protocols once I have full knowledge of what exactly they are. I have dealt with confidential documents or projects in the past and have experience with following the necessary procedures for keeping things under wraps.
This project is interesting to me because I'm most definitely not someone who is a natural at chemistry, biology, physics, or science in general.

I discovered the data science program slightly later than most, after taking data 8 and stat 88 for the economics major.  I loved these classes and then decided to pursue both majors.  I have experience in community and business development, product development, and working with technologies. Through my work experiences and inherit interests, I find myself inspired by the idea of applying technical data science to social issues, carefully and considerately. As such, I am seeking to gain experience in using analytics to benefit social good.","The projects the Discovery Research teams work on, are connected with the campus community and the city of Berkeley and Bay Area more broadly.  As such, along with gaining experience in data science research, being able to see the impact of your work within a local setting is what has drawn me to apply to Discovery Research.  Specifically, the focus on using data science in conjunction with non profits or environmental justice groups is unique work that I hope to gain experience in.  I also wish to gain a greater view of the data science community at Berkeley.  Through working with faculty, post-docs, and graduate students I believe the Discovery Research program provides this, allowing undergraduates a look into the academia around data science.","This past summer, I worked on a team project to create a pricing model comparison between our company and engineering service providers and certification service providers by the end of my internship term.  What we did to accomplish this was first divide the comparisons into our relative areas of interest/expertise.  I focused on certification service providers.  We then worked backwards from my end date to schedule meetings and deadlines for ourselves.  Initially we all worked on researching our areas for about a week and half.  Then we met again and started sharing our finding and developed the comparison aspect of our project.  This allowed each member of the team to understand each others portion, which is important in working with others.  

I think that breaking up work between team members can be extremely efficient if everyone is in agreement and if everyone has an understanding of what others are working on.  Otherwise, the final product will be disjoint and the team will not operate unified.
",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I have selected this project as my first choice, once again, because it falls in line with my aspirations and the kind of impact I wish to have through this program.  In the future I hope to use data science to have a positive impact on communities.  Hearing from my friend who went to Berkeley High, across and within Berkeley schools there is an evident achievement gap.  I think being able to quantify this, is very important to BUSD students and the health of the community.  Also, my mom is a social worker at 3 schools in Los Angeles Unified School District, and she experiences first hand the emotional manifestation of problems that are root causes of achievement gaps.  I am interested in this project because of the immediate and close impact it will have in changing how Berkeley unified school district addresses the needs of different students.
",Identifying Electricity Usage & Disconnection Patterns in Disadvantaged Communities,"I have selected this project because it falls in line with my aspirations and the kind of impact I wish to have through this program and in my future endeavors.  In the future I hope to use data science to have a positive impact on communities.  This project specifically is of interests to me because it continues through the ""data science lifecycle"" as the aim is to find patterns, and then use these patterns to further develop ways to help mitigate disconnections in the future.  The use of data science to drive policies or mitigation techniques is exciting to me.  Also of interest to me in this project is the immediate and close impact it will have in helping disadvantaged communities in the East Bay.",Data for Social Good,"I have selected this project because it falls in line with my aspirations to use data science to have a positive impact on a large scale.  I am interested in the intersection of data, public policy, and democracy, so your project's use of data to help bring louder voices to organizers and mobilize voters is something that I would love to take part in.

Furthermore, it would especially great to gain an exposure to Tableau and SciKit learning because I believe that can help me make the most out of Python as a CS language. I believe that I can use my Data Visualization skills to construct informative and understandable plots that create a bigger picture for users to understand.","My approach to teamwork is dividing tasks between different team members and constantly collaborating about improvements. It is always important to pitch  ideas and give constructive feedback about what individual members can improve on. For example, I was in charge of leading a group to create an algorithm for determine crimes around Berkeley within a given timeframe. As a team partner, my goal was to help individuals for what they can focus on, but also be a mentor for what problems needed to be focused on. As a team, I think that it is also important teaching your members valuable lessons, so that it can be enhanced to further improvements in the project dynamic.",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,I'm interested in this project because I believe that I can contribute to how the air quality has varied among UC Berkeley. Some key answers I want to look into is how the air quality has fluctuated over time and track occurrences of what cities or regions have experienced a lack of poor air quality. Some issues to explore is what causes these poor air qualities. I think I can provide some insights into what I want to look into and think of different approaches to create quality hotspots or a metric of whatever data I can use in particular.,Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,This is a pretty important project to me because it really serves an initiative or critical action for me to wonder how agriculture schools or universities have affected the food injustice in the US. Something I would like to focus on is the general curriculum of these universities and draw comparisons to view any potential drawbacks or improvements that can be made in the long-term. It is critical for me to understand these issues because I believe that there can be long-term impacts negatively that  don't serve much of a purpose for universities to improve their ,Data visualization and analytics for off-grid solar in Africa,"I've been a huge fanatic for data visualizations. Actually, I follow a sub-reddit that involves really sophisticated data visualizations. It sheds light for me to discover what I want to focus on in the long-term. It provides outcomes for me to figure out any potential ways I can show solar in Africa. I interned at BlueFlame Energy finance and my goal was to create a pricing model for different solar deals that needed to be constructed. I was able to create the model through Selenium and Python to understand what would be the most effective. It helps me explore and tackle challenges in different ways that I haven't really thought about before because it helps me explore any particular tasks I want to tackle in the future. It excites me to be a part of this team because I have always been interested in Africa as a culture and community to really focus on because the country deals with so many issues unnecessarily.

However, especially after taking Data 8, I noticed that the government placed a sincere lack of attention on some of the most important challenges facing our society. After all, members of our own Congress seemed so technically inept when tasked with making legislation to regulate the tech industry. I did not want to be one of those social science majors who was clueless about the technical and ethical ramifications of data. The narratives, and lies, that can be told with data in my field of political science can be dangerous. 

Although I am interested in several subfields of political science and public policy, I ultimately want to specialize in environmental policy through my minor in Conservation and Resource Studies. The way I see it, economic development, educational equality, and societal improvements must coexist with respect for the environment and responsible allocation of natural resources. Likewise, responsible work with environmental data is necessary for that appropriate allocation. ","The incredible research at Berkeley fascinates me. I have had a wonderful experience working with international relations professor Michaela Mattes through URAP. The research we have worked on involves making a database of international apologies for human rights abuses. The experience has been incredibly rewarding, and I am thankful for the mentorship I have received. However, I want a chance to engage in research where I can use my programming skills in a valuable setting. I loved the challenge of CS 61a and the strict logic of problem solving. However, since I no longer have time in my schedule to take CS classes, I worry that what I learned my soon go away. I also think that working with the more technical aspects of research will help me understand more of what it is like to pursue academia. I am still slightly unsure about what path I would like to to take after graduation, but I believe that working on a Discovery Research project could help give me some clarity. ","I think that the two most important aspects to teamwork are open communication and empathy.  It is necessary that each individual communicates their capacity honestly so that the rest of the team can allocate work effectively. Likewise, every person working a team must  have the patience to hear out the ideas of the other team members. In order to effectively listen, one must try and understand where the other members are coming from.

At my most recent internship, I used MySQL, Python, and Excel to build KPI dashboards and perform hypothesis tests for a fintech startup.  My favorite class at Cal has been Stochastic Processes, as I’m fascinated by trying to model random processes, such as through Markov Chains.  Given that people appreciate comfort in certainty, the study of probability helps us better understand a world full of uncertainties.   Apart from my schoolwork, I’m actively involved in TBP, the engineering honors society, providing food and organizing corporate infosessions for the club.

For me, understanding the course of the process is most important.  As such, I am not afraid to voice suggestions or improvements.  Ideally, work should be divided based on the relative expertise and experience of the members.  The partition into different tasks allows people the time and freedom to think and build any implementation.  However, I think it’s also necessary to understand teammates’ work so there is an opportunity to provide feedback and help if needed.

My name is Saumya and I am a freshman intending to major in Statistics and Data Science. I got into these fields by chance and gained skills over the summer by writing some projects in Python and consulting for nonprofit organizations to assist them in making databases, creating surveys, cleaning and collecting data, and more. Besides data science I am interested in astronomy, entrepreneurship, and math. These interests were found primarily through podcasts and research labs. In high school, I was in two astronomy research labs where I created a mobile microscope adapter and tracked the movement of stars in the night sky, respectively. In terms of entrepreneurship, I have been interested in creating my own nonprofit organization and would like to implement that within the next semester, so I am trying to learn more about business and creating organizations by attending competitions, networking events, and working for startups. Finally, math has been a lifelong interest of mine because I love working with numbers, thus I intend to major in statistics to combine my love for calculus with answering the probability-related questions I constantly think about. ","As a participant in the Discovery Research program, I am hoping to build skills in data science by learning more about ML libraries and applying them to a project. I am also interested in discovering more about NLP. I have done some work with TextBlob to find sentiment and perception values for news headlines, but I am interested in delving deeper by using word2vec, doc2vec, and more. I also want to explore the applications of data science to business. Currently, I am consulting for an automotive parts company in South Africa where we are running ML models to predict the optimal time to restock and quantity the company should order. Additionally, I am working on creating a route optimization discrete event simulation in my internship. These are the only two applications of data science to business I have worked with would like to expand my scope. Finally, I want to understand the process behind running a successful research lab or project as that is a path I am considering for the future; it would be a great opportunity for me to connect with team leads and gain insight about the process.","At a personal level, my approach to teamwork emphasizes reliability, independence, creativity, and problem solving. For example, I have been tasked with creating a simulation to predict pick-up and drop-off locations of ride hailers, ETAs, and fuel consumption of vehicles. This project requires ML knowledge that I am still developing, so I put in the extra effort to be successful. I schedule meetings with my bosses to discuss questions or do a code-review, I consult professors and upperclassmen friends, and go in to the office to put in additional hours. At a team level, active listening, being on deck for help at all times, and constant communication are the behaviors I’ve found to be most effective in managing a team. At the end of every club meeting with my committee, I take notes as my teammates speak and remind myself to wait before I speak. When our team lead needed a person to create visualizations of our dataset, I quickly offered to do so. Finally, I make sure to communicate with my team lead when any urgent concerns arise to solve them as quickly as possible.

At home, my childhood bedroom is covered wall to wall with maps of places I have lived, visited, or wanted to visit. Maps captivated me as an easy and aesthetically pleasing way to digest information, and I’ve spent countless hours studying different kinds of maps describing election results, historic migrations, or even just major freeways and transit lines. Aside from simply portraying geographic information, maps are immensely powerful as a tool to shape people’s perception of the world. They help dictate what is accepted as reality, and their use in informing (or misinforming) the public can have significant global impact. They fascinate me because of their beauty, simplicity, and power. More recently I have developed an interest in the topic of urbanism, especially regarding transportation and mobility. In the 2019 summer session, I took GEOG 70AC, ""The Urban Experience,"" from which I learned how inefficient and expensive public transit and congested freeways reflect poor planning practices, and about the historical discriminatory planning practices present in America. The essence of the course was that planning should be centered around the needs and interests of city residents, rather than the grand schemes of planners. I hope to further explore this interest through the Minor in City Planning.","I want to experience conducting research in an environment conducive to curiosity and active learning where I am also intellectually challenged. I believe that the Discovery Program will help me develop my skills and teach me research techniques relevant to my ideal career path in urban data science. Eventually, I want to work studying transit networks and public spaces to use data to help make cities more accessible and habitable to all demographics, and I feel that this program is the ideal first step in that direction.

I am also comfortable asking others for help when I need it while also making sure that I am contributing to the productivity of others. For example, as the president of my high school's robotics team, I had members record everything they worked on in a shared drive, and held meetings every other week to discuss our goals and progress. This process kept us all accountable and productive both individually and as a group, and made it easier for us to build off of our teammates' ideas and design a better robot than any of us could have done individually.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"The goals of this project are to directly help disadvantaged young people, and I am very much drawn to the idea of using data science to make information more accessible and to help people who need it.

I was placed in a small town in Germany where no one really spoke English. This gave me a lot of time to introspect, learn from my two years at Berkeley and find my true passion. 

Having personally experienced the vast differences between the education systems of India and the United States, I realized my dream of disrupting this education system back home and started planning my next two years at Berkeley to gain the necessary skills.

Technology will be key to such a movement and I’ve worked to establish a solid base in VR/AR, Education, Web development and HCI research over the past two years. Building off these skills I’ve explored product management and the non-technical side of products via classes at Berkeley and industry experience. 

In the real world, all critical decisions regarding strategy and development will be based on huge datasets. Therefore, I took CS189 and Data 100 to get a solid base in data analysis and visualization, feature engineering and creating machine learning models. Building off these classes, I want to gain exposure and experience working with real-world datasets.","During the summer of 2019, I stepped out of my comfort zone and worked as an ML research intern under the autonomous driving wing of the German Aerospace Center. I created an ML model to predict the frustration levels of passengers and drivers which then contribute to the overall decision model for autonomous cars. This harsh yet informative introduction to data manipulation and neural nets sparked in me a great curiosity for this field.

Therefore, to understand the fundamentals of the data science lifecycle and the underlying math behind these models I took Data 100 and CS189 during Fall 2019.
During Fall 2019, I also was able to solidify my technical skills through work on my sports AR startup, VR/Robotics research, web application to combat biased news and personal website. 

This background and experience gives me the confidence to apply for this program to gain exposure and experience working in real-world scenarios while contributing to the project. I have never experienced working with large scale datasets in an industry or research setting. Therefore am extremely keen to learn the frameworks and gain experience manipulating and building models in this setting.","My first experience working with a team came playing varsity basketball in highschool. Looking back today, those four years were hard, frustrating, awesome and extremely rewarding. As we played together, I learned the importance of recognizing one’s weaknesses and then communicating these to support one another. As old faces graduated and new transfers joined, I learned to open up and grow comfortable with anyone quickly to ensure we all worked well together.

These core skills carried over to Berkeley and were refined to work in a competitive technical environment. Group projects, research and club experiences augmented the importance of honesty, communication and distributing credit to ensure a happy environment. 

As a project lead for my research group and founder of a startup, it’s these qualities I champion. Honesty about one’s strengths and weaknesses help set a realistic time-line and reduce the chances of stress and surprises during development. A constant stream of communication allows for collaboration, crowd-sourcing error and ensure no repetition of tasks. These hard to implement ideals, which we have proudly achieved over this semester have resulted in not just impressive deliverables but also strong friendships and great experiences amongst the team, which truly made it special.",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I was hospitalized in second grade for a dislocated hip joint and while I never suffered from any clerical errors, the extremely slow treatment kept me in a hospital bed for a year. Therefore, the thought of someone suffering because of missing diagnostic information is simply horrific and I would be honored to contribute to such an amazing initiative. 

I once attempted a similar project to fill out patient forms using speech-to-text and NLP algorithm to improve doctor patient interactions at a hack-a-thon and experienced the various technical problems one can face when attempting such NLP algorithms. 

Working with facial video, heart rate, GSR, and pupil dilation data in Germany to build models predicting human emotions allowed me to grow very comfortable with unclear datasets and performing industry level feature extraction.

Further work during the Fall 2019 semester using NLP algorithms for a biased news web application and speech-to-text AWS services for my startup have helped me grow comfortable in this field. And finally Data 100 and CS189 served as a great fundamental understanding of the DS lifecycle and the mathematics behind popular models if customization is needed.

In addition to working at the German Aerospace Center, I work with the Gopnik psychology lab and the VIVE center at UC Berkeley which all deal with confidential human subject data. This has helped me respect and grow familiar with the necessary security protocols.  

Finally, I believe my experience with AWS, large architecture stacks and full-stack development would allow us to develop the MVP for the instant messaging system and even integrate with an existing hospital database if required.",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"My summer working in Germany was a rollercoaster to say the very least, and I met an EDM music producer one day. We talked about how EDM beats coupled with a few words had the ability to tell a story and how if these select few words meant different things in various languages, people from different parts of the world could hear different or even similar stories. 

For example: Ki Huva in Punjabi, Kya Hua in Hindi and Que Huba (pronounced as Ke) in Spanish is the same thing: What Happened.

Upon further research, while finding a set of words which are spelt and mean similar things is possible, finding a set of words which sound the same was a lot harder. This research did lead m to some interesting and extremely deep articles on deciphering acoustic data and exploring these subsets using machine learning. 

I didn’t have the time or knowledge to dive deep into this field during Fall 2019, so I spent it gaining a solid understanding of machine learning. Data 100, CS189, a sentiment analysis powered Twitter trading bot, NLP powered true news application, and speech-to-text AWS integrations for my startup have given me exposure and experience with data science, general ML models and NLP specifically.

I’ve always build a healthy relationship by applying my technical back to a collaborative project when my passion for education has helped me learn about this field while my peers learn about the fascinating power of technology. 

I’ve had the opportunity to apply my UX research skills to an anthropology project. My web development skills to build a web application to combat biased news online and a website for the international students community at Berkeley. My VR development skills to HCI robotics research, psychology research and an architecture startup. My AR development skills to my sports startup and radiation visualization research.

I'm a senior from the Bay Area double majoring in Cognitive Science and Data Science. I declared Data Science as a second major because I wanted to be able to find impactful solutions for the world through the wealth of information that exists today. 

I am also interested in hackathons, and just completed one recently at MIT! Although I went as a beginner in web development, I was fortunate enough to be in a team that was not only extremely supportive, but also open to ideas for projects. I loved the process of discussing innovative solutions to big problems, poking holes at them, and then figuring out a better way together. 

I am also proud of my work in the service organization, The Berkeley Project, here at UCB. I served as Volunteer Director for a year, leading a team to train service leaders to lead volunteers in small groups throughout Berkeley on Berkeley Project Day (semesterly service event where 2000+ volunteers come together to save the City $500k annually). I led orientations, improved the efficiencies within the organization, and made sure that my co-leader and I cultivated our team to be as cohesive and impactful as possible.","I want to become a better data scientist, researcher, and problem solver. Without a doubt, this opportunity would allow me to learn tons of new data science techniques and practices, from teammates, project leads, and the project itself. There's also so much to learn from diving into the data, working with industry professionals, and researching the project context. 

I'm a strong believer in, ""the more effort you put into something, the more you'll get out of it."" I know that with this opportunity, I will push myself to learn as much as I can and as fast as I can, to contribute to the best of my ability and thus making the most of the experience for myself too. 

I also want to contribute towards social good, and working on the Water Project will allow me to contribute towards an impactful project that I believe will help many people. ","When I'm in a team, I'm all-in and strive to create a safe space for everyone to learn, participate, and feel included. I hold myself accountable, and knowing that others are dependent on my contribution drives me to do the best I can and give my all. I've also learned the importance--and joy--of being an inclusive and collaborative team member. I think the best teams work to cultivate growth mindsets and support each other through creating a safe space where anyone can ask questions without the fear of being judged as inadequate. It's so important for everyone's voices to be heard, and for the whole team to be on the same page together. When I'm on a team, I bring these values with me and keep myself accountable to act on them every time, whether it's little things like asking to do round robins for brainstorming, or just checking to make sure everyone is on the same page. ",Automated Water Purification,"I worked on this project during Fall 2019 and would love to continue to work on it during the spring. When I first heard about this project, I was extremely drawn to the problem it was trying to solve: making water clean and accessible. Clean water should be a basic human right, and yet around 50,000 people in California drink arsenic contaminated water every day. I believe our team worked extremely well together, from teaching each other new things we learned each week, to discussing solutions together. I was given the role of working on the mobile application aspect of the project, and was able to learn how to design a UX wireframe, develop in React Native, and configure Firebase for the backend. I also was grateful to be able to attend the CA Data Water Summit in Sacramento to represent the team, and look forward to continue working with and learning from others in this sector to move the project forward. However, there is still a lot to do before the field trial in next summer, and I would love to contribute towards finishing the automation of ECAR before then. ",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"Environmental justice is something everyone should care about, but the unfortunate truth is that people of color, people of lower socioeconomic status, and minority groups bear the worst of environmental damage. Having taken an environmental ethics course this semester, I have been working to be more aware and active towards environmental justice issues, and another way I would love to contribute is through this project. Educating the public and providing tools for advocates and policymakers would be extremely valuable and something I am very passionate about. I also have interest in spatial data analysis and have experience in Python and web development.

I’m a peer advisor and student member of Berkeley Hope Scholars, a program for former foster youth here at Cal. One of my goals is to shine light onto underrepresented groups through research and effectively proven outreach.
A reason that attracted me to my field of study was the tangible nature of humanity through data. To fully appreciate our growing datafied world, one must acknowledge the multi-faceted points that exist in our societies. I believe we can utilize data to improve systems and policies that affect our day to day life, not just what we purchase on Amazon. My hope is that a comprehensive analysis could streamline problem solving in our society. I've had to work to support myself over the years; My outside work experiences has fitted me to leading, collaborating, and supporting team members to accomplish goals. I take my contributions seriously and relish in the pride I can muster from my work. Being accountable, diligent, and considerate of people are keystones I like to model my actions under. ",My hope is that participating in the Discovery Research will help me foster my data driven research skills so I can possibly conduct my own research effectively independently some day. Working alongside other people and seeing the different ways of approaching problem solving helps me grow as a person. Exposure to foreign ways of thinking prevents me from falling victim to narrow modes of thought and prepares me as a data scientist for the real world. ,I always approach team oriented tasks with a flexible attitude. Getting to know members as best I can to understand how I can react better to improve the team flow is one of my big priorities. I see teamwork as a positive flow of energy that when done well elevates all of the members including those that may be weaker at some given moment. When everyone is carried to the same level I believe communication is increased and work can be done faster and better. For these reasons I see teamwork as a continuous group effort to offer each others' strengths and weaknesses to yield the best work from the group members.,Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"The capitalization of the cannabis market is creating a barrier to the traditional holistic health benefits that cannabis has to offer. To date, legislative efforts to lower state taxes have fallen short, meaning the legal supply chain continues to struggle to attract customers. With additional regulations and costs the price norms of Cannabis have been affected. With legalization of cannabis becoming more foreseeable the cannabis market can expect change. Understanding the needs of diversity within the industry while its becomes capitalized by rich stockholder/investors is key to keep the industry balanced is key. I'm interested in this project as I have Through personal friends I have noticed the high employment turnover rate as capitalization drives cutting corners in treatment, quality, and prices. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"It is historic in the United States how wealth has shaped neighborhoods and communities within them. The Federal Housing Act of 1934 brought home ownership within reach of millions of citizens by placing the credit of the federal government behind private lending to home buyers, but it channeled almost all of the loans toward whites. Factors like these intrigue me as they contour the way in which marginalized communities develop and are changed by societal influences. The way in which disadvantaged communities are affected will vary from more affluent communities. Recording these variances help us better react and understand the systemic issues affecting us. It's important to appreciate how each community is impacted in large changes so we can install preventative measures to mediate negative influences. As a member of a marginalized community I have an invested interest in understanding the people of disadvantaged demographics as it indirectly/directly affects me as well. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,As a former foster youth I know first hand the risks associated with homelessness. I think that homeless youth are an underrepresented population that aren't receiving the proper attention/resources. Documenting evidence of this demographic can help kindle understanding and support by garnering attention to the problems and policies that help or don't help them. Gaining a statistical catalog of homeless youth violence will help improve the ways in which society can prevent the problem from continuing by implementing effectively proven policies and resources needed to help. ,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,I applied last Fa'19 to the Discovery Research but was waitlisted.  ,N/A,"Berkeley Hope Scholars, EOP, Nav Cal, System Impacted",Ira Young,If allotted the opportunity I would show my deep gratitude through my dedicated drive to better myself and others around me as it would be immensely beneficial to my future aspirations.

Few years ago, I was an ordinary high school kid in South Korea, but I decided to go study abroad to the island, Guam, which is located near the Philippines. The reason why I moved to Guam is to learn new language, English, which is broadly used by the majority of people in the world. This was a dramatic choice and opportunity, which leads me to a broader vision to the world. At that moment, I really had a strong desire to learn English and listened carefully what high school teachers said and learned it passionately.  At the beginning of the high school year, I wanted to be a doctor, so I had an internship at a hospital as a rehabilitator intern. Furthermore, besides those sections, I am also into history, which is especially on planes.

In the army, everything is squad (team) based. There’s no such thing as a one-man mission. Trusting each other and great communication skills were the most important values in building and maintaining strong teamwork. I believe teamwork is not only important in the army but also in society. I might not have needed to collaborate in a team if I were a genius but fortunately I’m not. I’m a person who value teamwork and believe as a team we can do greater things. I love to play sports with my team members because exercising together is a fast and easy way to build a good teamwork. Whenever there’s a conflict I try to resolve it as soon as possible. Even if there’s a seemingly trivial conflict, if we do not eradicate it in a timely manner, it might lead to bigger problems.

I would love to be involved with directly with improving and making Kiwibot more efficient for its customers. I bring advanced skills in Python and strong skills in Data Visualization and Data Manipulation libraries. I also have experience in Machine Learning and Geospatial libraries. In my prior research experience, I built an anisotropic magnetoresistance measurement setup from a Biaxial Magnetic Probe Station and used Gauss Meters and KEPCO voltage power supply to find correct measurements for setup to help create high efficient antennas.  My analysis on the measurements had a direct impact on the research towards making higher efficient antennas since I had to take the data I recorded and analyze it directly. I am also very eager to learn more about Kiwibots and hope to expand my technical skills. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"As a woman in tech, I believe that is very important to have resources and proper spaces and support for women in STEM fields. Women in STEM fields make the minority.

My maternal grandparents were first generation immigrants.  When they arrived in America, they left everything behind and started from scratch in pursuit of a better life for their family. My paternal grandparents were born in internment camps during World War II.  Their families were stripped of all possessions and forced to re-establish their lives with nothing but $25 and a train ticket. As a result, my parents raised me to never take anything for granted, work hard for things I want, and be prepared for any of life’s unpredictable challenges.  

I'm passionate for the subjects of Computer Science and Data Science.  I want to learn as much as I can while I am in college so eventually I can apply the skills I learn in the future.  I am excited for any opportunity I can get to further my understanding of these two subjects.","I’d love to join the Discovery Research program because I desire to join a tight-knit community of people I can always turn to throughout college, even when I’m struggling. Not only is it a privilege to be able to work with people with the same passion as me, but I would acquire priceless knowledge to become an expert in the future. I know Data Science is a field I want to delve deeper into in the future. Discovery would permit me practical and hands-on experience required to become an expert.  Discovery Research’s projects intrigue me and would be an extreme privilege to be able to contribute to. I have always possessed a thirst for learning and a drive to never give up. I believe Discovery is the perfect opportunity not only for me to use prior knowledge, but to build my skills so I can apply them to make a difference in the future.  I would also be enabled to help my peers so that they could acquire the same passion for Machine Learning that I do.  Overall, I desire to explore the endless fields of Data Science, and this program seems like the perfect place to start.","When working with a team, chemistry is essential to me.  Being a baseball player for over 10 years, I believe teamwork can make or break a team.  The last four years not only did I get to play 750+ innings of baseball with my baseball team, but I also got to bond with and understand each and every one of the individuals. Every practice, every game, every team dinner…I cherished because I was able to instill trust in my teammates. What was unique about our team was that we could rely on each other, whether on or off the field. We weren’t fighting for starting positions, but rather working together so we could all carry out our own specific roles to attain our common goal: winning the championship. I felt like a part of my baseball team because I was ALWAYS supported whenever I struck out or made an error. At the end of the day, my teammates knew I was putting 100% effort on the field, which induced confidence in me. So I did the same. I tried being the leader, the role model that demonstrates he never gives up.

",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"This project was interesting to me as I come from a disadvantaged public school education that was always full of predominantly minorities in Buena Park, California. I was always aware of how disadvantaged our public schools in my hometown because even from within our school district, our high school was known as “ghetto” high school because of its history as well as what our demographics looked like. Ultimately, it is well known that private schools are offered and funded better than public schools so I thought this project was cool. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"This project interests me because there is a clear distinction of the male dominance within the tech industry, specifically white and Asian male dominance. It is not as common, popular for women to find a career/educational path in the tech world. Even here at Berkeley, being a Latina who is interested in the tech world, I find it hard to stay motivated as there is slight to no representation; it is very uncommon to see people who look like me.

I am privileged to not have to worry about my immediate survival. So I am usually looking for ways to make my life feel meaningful and fulfilling. Before college, I was super into playing the cello. I played in orchestras and had the chance to go to Prague to play for about a month. Then sometime in high school, I discovered Physics and decided I really enjoyed it at the time. In college, I got scared out of studying physics and did Applied Mathematics instead. School work sort of took over a few years of my life. I struggled with academic stress which often led to existential crises at the ripe age of 18-19.  I like to think that I have conquered the feeling that I was defined by my academic and professional accomplishments. Now I’m back to discovering interests that make my life feel fullfilling. Recently I’ve been getting into drawing and watching lots and lots of movies. I’ve always enjoyed other people’s art and now I’m trying to make my own. ","Since I will be graduating soon, I am looking for ways to develop my Data Science / Analytics skills. Sometimes, the things that I am taught in class feel a little bit too theoretical. Although the theory is super important in helping you deeply understand a topic, I am also looking to develop very practical and applicable skills. Being a part of Discovery has been AMAZING thus far in helping me gain that experience. I have learned so much over the last year in this program and I really really want to continue learning in this space. I was a part of the WAHVE project for 3 phases now so I am hoping to participate in a new project. This way, I will be able to learn about how data science is applied to a different field/industry. I am also looking forward to being able to apply what I learned with WAHVE to a new project. I am curious to see what skills seem to be universal and which ones need to be altered to fit a particular project or industry. ","My ideal team is one that facilitates a comfortable and welcoming environment in which every member feels valued. I think that many students struggle with ""imposter syndrome"" because they do not feel that they are as smart as their peers. Students with imposter syndrome often feel like a burden and like it was a mistake that they were admitted into a program/institution. I do not believe a team can function at full capacity if any member finds themselves feeling like an imposter. Members should instead feel comfortable reaching out for help instead of taking shortcuts / wasting time to save face in front of team members. Reaching out for help should not be a sign of weakness or incompetency. Furthermore, when every member of a team feels valued and welcomed on a team, then they will be more encouraged to think outside the box and take initiative on a project. Everyone should be able to feel ownership of whatever they are working on. ",Kiwibot delivery robots,"I really really really love Kiwibots. They are so adorable and their little face never fails to bring me joy. I love it when they :) at me. 

On a more serious note, I became aware of the challenges of automated delivery at a random party a while ago. One of my friends was working with Kiwibots at the time. At that party, he explained to me the challenges of teaching Kiwibots how to cross the street. I was fascinated by that challenge. Ever since that short conversation, the ""Kiwibot crossing a street"" problem was an example I gave to friends and family who wanted to know what Data Science was. I am so excited to see Kiwibots on this semester's list. I am fascinated by automated delivery and every time I see a kiwibot on campus, I wonder what type of analysis went into helping the bot learn how to navigate space on its own. I am also really drawn to this project because it has a direct impact on my immediate community. As students with busy schedules, estimated delivery times are crucial. I would LOVE a chance to try my hand at this problem. ",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"""Inclusive cyberspace is not equal to the absence of online hate speech""

This line grabbed my attention. As a Gender Studies minor and intersectional/transnational feminist, the dichotomy between inclusivity and hate is something that really interests me. With this dichotomy often comes the assumption that the absence of one means the presence of the other. But the quote above really interrogates this and pushes us to focus on inclusivity instead of just hate speech. This is a perspective I never really considered. Often time, I am so focused on identifying and reacting to hate speech, that I do not spend as much time identifying spaces of inclusivity. I would be super interested in looking at how this dichotomy plays out in the cyber space. I am super curious as to how a machine learning model will be able to identify this difference when it is so difficult for humans to do so on our own. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I just wrote a research paper in my Gender Studies class that is related to this project. In my paper, I explored the Asian American model minority myth's role in erasing the intersectional struggles of the Asian American community. I interrogated this idea that ethnicity alone is enough to determine educational success. Working on this project will give me an opportunity to look beyond just Asian Americans to see how income and ethnicity impacts achievement in public schools. As a product of the public school system myself, I deeply believe in the value of a public education. Being a part of this project will give me a way to impact the system that I have grown up in myself.

Kathak taught me that creativity can be found anywhere. Whether it is a girl dancing on the streets in the rain, or graffiti splattered on the walls, I began to identify the aesthetic appeal behind the simplest things. This helped me realize communication is not limited to just word, but movements are an equally important factor in expressing ourselves, which helped transform me into a confident and articulate communicator. 

Additionally, swimming has helped to center me as a person. Realizing the real-life parallels that it espouses, it has taught me the importance of every breath and helps me to maintain emotional and physical equilibrium.The water in the pool also acts as the source of my energy and compels me to keep moving forward, no matter what difficult position I am in. It is the perfect workout for both the mind and the body, and doubles as a stress-buster. Swimming has continued to be an integral part of my life and has helped shape my personality into what it is today. Most of my days go by in a whirlwind of classes, homework, dancing, and swimming. 
","Data Science is the future of the world, helping companies and business owners to manage business operations and live by utilizing specialized software and algorithms. In doing, so we are shaping the world. The world is already dominated by the technology industry. I am extremely interested in Discovery Research because it will help me hone my skills by giving me real-world knowledge, which would be invaluable in helping me establish my career. I think it is extremely important to spread information about the essential aspects of technology-driven data strategies, helping people to make better informed decisions. One aspect of data science that especially interests me is the fact that it is breaking down borders. The aim is to break any global barriers and use these global services to enable technological advancements across the world. This industry will help me challenge myself and enable me to become part of a group of people who challenge the status quo and even overturn it. Becoming a part of Discovery Research would give me an opportunity to stay ahead of these particular innovations and quickly grasp these trends in this technology-driven world. ","I am an avid believer in the benefits of teamwork. I have seen first-hand, the success in various different parts of my life due to teamwork. As the head of Event Management in high school, I was caught up in the whirlwind of preparations for the Trident, our school's prestigious inter-school sports and cultural event. The sheer amount of work was overwhelming for a single person to handle, and would have been impossible, had I not worked in close collaboration with everyone- from school support staff to teachers, as well as my peers.

Creating a strong core team was vital because I wanted a group of competent and cohesive people who could come together and elevate what we were striving to accomplish. When planning events in school, there were unforeseen hurdles, and had I been working alone, it would have been impossible to make the event a staggering success. In my opinion, it is best to identify the strengths of all team members, and then delegating work to them based on their strengths and ideas. Playing to team members' strong suits is vital for maximum success in a team, and also prevents any internal conflicts and arguments. Communication is essential is an integral component to bridge any gaps, and ensure that the team works together as a single unit. ",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"As a child, I was extremely interested in the workings of the justice system in the United States and how there were different courts of law for different cases. In high school, I participated in an internship at the G.D. Goenka University's School of Law where my interest was piqued once more. As a Data Science major I would love to use my technological skills and apply them to a field that I am highly interested in. I would also like to explore how the Supreme Court decides which cases are important, and whether or not there is a certain degree of biases buried in this decision-making process. This project would be the perfect way to help me gain real-world knowledge and apply my theoretical learnings in a helpful and analytical way. ",Kiwibot delivery robots,"Ever since I stepped foot at UC Berkeley, I feel in love with Kiwibots. They were both amusing and inspiring- the startup was launched in Berkeley itself. I downloaded the app immediately, however I was soon faced with the issue where I was unaware when my food would reach, or if it was stuck. Competing apps in the market have a feature that predicts the estimated time of arrival, based on thousands of similar deliveries, for the food, and is a large part of why these competitors are attracting customers who originally used Kiwibots. Since I identify with this issue, I would love to be part of the team that helps analyze the problem, and eventually fix it to improve the user experience for Kiwibots which are so widely loved across campus. ",Data Enabled Donations,"Community service is not only my passion, but my mantra. Ever since elementary school, I have aspired to give back including food drives, clothing drives, and fundraisers. As I grew older, my efforts expanded. I led my school's community service initiative where we formulated a business plan to raise money for the Action Center for Transformation charity. We designed hand-made art projects and sold them across the city in an effort to gain funds for less-fortunate children in the city who needed a place to learn and stay off the streets. Through this project, I will be able to apply my technological skills in order to analyze a way to maximize donations, with special emphasis on shelters after a disaster. This will enable me to combine my two passions in life- data science and giving back to the community.

My name is Michelle, and I’m a second-year student studying Data Science and minoring in Education. Academically, I enjoy studying statistical modeling and data visualization. Furthermore, I really love learning about education and mentoring/tutoring students. I had a lot of amazing STEM mentors in college, and I think it’s really important and rewarding to give back to the community.

I currently work in the Cal Alumni Association, where I help create reports regarding scholarship and financial aid information. Besides this, I also work on a student team in the Division of Data Sciences, where I help develop projects and homework for Data100. In my free time, I love spreadsheet planning and journaling. I also really love board games (my favorite is Pandemic!), and I often arrange game nights for me and my friends. ","A lot of my experience with coding and data analysis has been academic, and I think it would be a great opportunity for me to apply what I have learned to a project that has real-world impact. I recently completed a project where I was predicting the popularity of Netflix movies. While I enjoyed this experience, I want to participate in something more collaborative and structured. I really like the Discovery program in particular because of its emphasis on collaboration and mentorship. Through Discovery, I hope to not only gain more technical knowledge and experience, but also learn more about the impact and ethical concerns of data science. Furthermore, I would like to meet more students who have the same academic and personal interests so we can collaborate and support each other. Data science is a very collaborative subject, and it would be a really amazing opportunity for me to be able to work with faculty and students interested in the same subjects as me so we can learn from one another. ","When working in a team, I personally think it is most effective for teams to complete some tasks individually, and then talk through their successes and struggles with the tasks together. This way, all members are able to learn new things and do a few tasks on their own, while still receiving mentorship and guidance from the other members. I also believe it is really important to divide up tasks incrementally, because I have found that when allocating tasks that are too large, this often leads people to be unmotivated and overwhelmed. 

I believe that the most important aspect of teamwork is communication. I believe it is more important to communicate your strengths and weaknesses rather than try to hide them, so everyone in the group can play to each other’s strengths and work through each other's weaknesses. Furthermore, when working in a team, I strive to ensure that everyone is putting in an equal amount of effort. Since some members of a team may have more experience in certain fields, I believe it is more important for every member to complete aspects of the projects that they can, rather than try to all complete the same task. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I am from Maryland, and my school system often placed magnet programs in under-resourced and underperforming schools to boost test scores. I attended one of these programs, and seeing the inequality between the two groups of students was really shocking to me. I felt as though there was a lot more support and encouragement for students in the magnet programs as opposed to the other students, and this seemed extremely unfair. I noticed that our schools test scores and factors such as socioeconomic status and race were very interrelated. 

Ever since this experience, I’ve been really interested in education and the achievement gap. I would like to explore what factors impact how students learn, student motivation, and the achievement gap. I have had experience in researching education through courses, and I’m particularly interested in researching the relationship between tracking and public school education. I think tracking is such an interesting concept because it makes such a large impact on a students academic and career path. I would like to explore more about the impact of tracking on students, and whether or not it exacerbates the achievement gap. ",Data Enabled Donations,"Data Enabled Donations really stands out to me because of its direct and positive impact on underprivileged communities. I think it is important to optimize and not necessarily maximize donations given to shelters, because some shelters may receive many more donations than others. I think it would be really cool to explore the types of donations that shelters have and why specific shelters may have more donations than others (i.e, family-oriented shelters or women’s shelters may have more donations). 

I have experience with app development through working on an iOS app, Metabolic Modeling. I was hired through the Lawrence Hall of Science to complete an app that helps students learn about metabolic modeling and cellular functions. From this, I have some experience with HTML/CSS/app development. For this project, I think it would be really interesting to study if shelters near particular areas have more donations. For example, shelters near universities may have more donations because of the student population. Factors like this could be used in algorithms to optimize donations. ",Cal Alumni Association Analysis of Engaged Alumni,"I currently work at Cal Alumni Association, and while I have primarily assisted with scholarship data, I have also been involved with volunteer and alumni engagement. I believe that the Cal Alumni Association’s mission is very important because it connects alumni to students. This benefits both the students and alumni, because alumni are able to mentor students, and students are able to explore and learn about opportunities post-graduation. Furthermore, I believe that higher education helps foster development and growth among students, so many alumni may want to give back or stay connected to Cal. 

I think it would be really interesting to explore the demographics of engaged alumni. For example, are the more engaged alumni often younger? Do alumni of certain majors or departments tend to engage more? From there, an interesting task could be analyzing market strategies to appeal to alumni that are less engaged. For example, we may be able to explore a digital marketing campaign to better engage younger alumni. I think that CAA data could be extremely interesting and informative about Berkeley students and alumni, and I would love to participate in this project to help CAA maximize its engagement.

When I transferred to Cal, I was originally declared as a Political Economy major. I had always loved political theory and the social sciences so this seemed to be a perfect fit. However, in the back of my mind, I had always known that computer science and data science will be a powerful driver for social and political change. Knowing this, I decided to change my major to Interdisciplinary Studies, allowing me to take classes in the fields that I have always enjoyed like political theory, economics, and demography while also taking classes in computer science and data science. Through integrating technical classes into a humanities-based curriculum the major switch has provided me with a perfect mixture of technical and behavioral insight. Interdisciplinary Studies also allows me to conduct independent research in my field of interest; two ideas that I am considering for my senior thesis are the Social and Political Implications of Targeted Marketing on Social Media and the Effects of Macroeconomic policy on Different Demographic Groups. Through the Discover Program, I hope to discover what about Data Science and Social Sciences that I am particularly interested in while learning how to conduct legitimate academic research on my own. ","I hope that the Discovery program will enable me to learn more about what branch of data/social science I am interested in while teaching me the skills and techniques associated with legitimate data science research. These two goals are very important for me because of my senior Interdisciplinary Studies research. Considering that I haven’t found exactly what I want to research yet, I think the Discovery Program will be a great platform for me to learn more about what is out there. The Discovery Program will also provide me with much-needed familiarity with the tools of data science before I embark on my own research project. Another aspect of the program that I am looking forward to is the opportunity for mentorship. This aspect of the program will be indispensable for my career and academic development and is perhaps the thing I am most excited about. ","There are a few conditions that, if not previously established, I feel compelled to develop whenever I am working with a team; to me, it is important to establish (1) effective lines of communication, (2) a productive and empathetic rapport, and (3) a clear understanding of the goals and intentions of the project at hand. As a member of Blockchain at Berkeley, I implemented this framework on several different occasions; one of which, for a case competition in a Graduate level Blockchain class last semester. Although I was the only undergraduate on the team, I immediately took responsibility of setting up a Slack channel for our group. While we developed the concept for the case, I pushed everyone to voice their opinions and asked if every member agreed before making decisions. After establishing an open channel of communication and a productive rapport between group members, we were able to stick to weekly goals and meetings throughout the semester. By the time our presentation came around, we had developed a concise project that we confidently pitched to our classmates.",Computational Analysis of Social Science Research,I feel that it overlaps with my research interests the most.,Forecasting Day Ahead Electric Load using a Machine Learning Application and Bottom-up Aggregation of Individual Meters,"I really want to learn ML, seems like a great project to do that.

As I tested out more Computer Science classes, I steadily grew more interested in technology and its wide applications. Data Science and Computer science allows me to use my creativity in a pursuit that can fundamentally change the world for the better. The combination of a pre-med background and classes on public health, development, and environment urge me to utilize Data Science and technology to elevate these fields for a healthier, sustainable future.
","I hope to gain more knowledge on the processes of data collection, cleaning, and modeling in real world applications, especially as they pertain to social good. I would like to learn from team members and create meaningful connections with peers. Discovery Research also provides a way to explore the Data Science field and aid me in my future projects. Furthermore, participation in a real research project is exciting since it allows me to see the real impacts of Data Science on the world.
","I believe that a good team can elevate a project due to the different perspectives and ideas of all the members. My approach to teamwork is interactive and inquiring, supporting all members to feel safe and included.

In addition, this project works with open sourced Facebook AI and mapping, which I think is an interesting approach to this problem. These resources are a new topic that would be amazing to learn about so that I can apply it to future development issues. Overall, I think the technology and methods used in this project are highly intriguing and the result of the project is an impact on people’s lives.

This project explores energy patterns and disconnection patterns. I would like to see in what ways these patterns are affected. How do geographical, socioeconomic, and wealth factors affect these patterns? What other factors are there that I have not considered? Thus, I could learn from my peers and research mentors how to perform data analysis for social good. I have briefly explored machine learning in my classes before, but a real life application to energy would give new insight on different methods. Through this project, I can practice data analyzation skills, while also improving the lives of those who need it most.",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"Learning about food insecurity and development in Berkeley classes led me to ponder what I could do to improve food equity for all people. Thus, this project provides an exploration of the applications of data science to food education and accessibility. I think it would be intriguing to learn how land-grant institutions may incorporate food equity into their curriculum heavily or ignore the topic entirely. What methods are most useful in promoting these topics? I also think it would be intriguing to view if institutions could paradoxically promote diversity, yet not offer equity-oriented curriculum. Overall, this project allows me to explore the ways data science can be used for social good. Furthermore, this project promotes a team-oriented, hands on project, which is the supportive environment I am searching for.

Curriculum Developer @ UC Berkeley Division of Data Sciences and Information",Yes,Math 54 / Stat 89A,https://drive.google.com/open?id=163IluWkrGdoKhNjEBEYRLRk92zXAWtnv,"My life goal is to become an expert in the field of Structural Health Monitoring. With such expertise, I will develop scalable technologies that will ensure the structural integrity of infrastructure in underdeveloped communities where the failure of foreign experts and contractors to transfer relevant technology and a weak maintenance culture have led to catastrophes. Outside of academic and coupled to that goal, I am conducting an Honors Undergraduate Research where I am working on a project which involves assessing the efficacy of Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry by Luna Innovation to quantify crack width in concrete frame structures. This experience is tremendously leveraging my knowledge of assessment method techniques and is providing me the opportunity to co-author a research paper on the topic. I am hoping to help advance design and assessment methods techniques that could be used in daily practice by structural engineers and researchers. For fun, I like running and swimming. Those activities help me achieve an adequate work-life balance by recognizing that my mental health is as essential to my physical health. Positive approach toward my mental health leads me to make meaningful contributions to the academic and social communities around me.","During our first orientation meeting early this semester, as one of the Student Curriculum Developer, we were told that the division goal is to “connects faculty, researchers, and students from a range of disciplines to advance data science discovery and impact.” With that goal in mind, I believe that with the Data Science Discovery Program coupled with my interest in research related to areas of sensing, monitoring, control, and intelligent systems, will allow me to understand performance-based engineering and engineering monitoring concepts from another perspective, leading to more intellectual freedom, knowledge mobilization, and translation across structural engineering, data science, and computational studies. As a result, the Data Science Discovery program appears to be the proverbial shoes to help me take the crucial next step in achieving my goal of developing sensor technologies and methodologies to transform the future of infrastructure and design-performance analyses through smart information. This means providing me with extensive computational skills to deepen my coding know-hows allowing me to get used to investigate, clean, analyze, and visualize big-data resulting from sensor analysis. That is the Data Science Discovery program would help me learn how to establish reliability analysis, therefore, providing information about the relationships between the environmental variables and the state of infrastructure or a city. As a result, humans will be more aware of their surroundings and use that awareness to arrive at solutions to problems in a short and efficient amount of time.","The single most important part of working in a group is cultivating the ideal of servant leadership as a philosophy and practice through which one supports and enables team members to reach their full potential. Such an idea would not be possible without strong relationships with peers, relationships based on trust, respect, integrity, curiosity, humility, compassion, and excellence. Team members learn to focus on the end goal and to develop intermediate goals while being useful in the evaluation of benchmarks and milestones, creating a vision for the greater good of the team, including a healthy disregard for the impossible and articulating action steps necessary to implement the said vision. 
Taking myself as an example, my background has been a journey of collaborative leadership experiences centered on inclusive and dynamic conversations while working with several students from different parts of Africa, Yale University and now at Berkeley. Developing world-changing ideas cannot only be the fruit of individual work but, rather, a combination of effort that reaches beyond one perspective. Through joint accountability towards the vision and common objective, members in a group can push and motivate each other more than an individual can; members of a group can back each other up more easily and equalize fluctuations in individual productivity. My unique perspectives and experiences as a young African leader stand as an example of the collaborative success that comes from connections with other individuals. These connections were turned the difference between our cultures and idiosyncrasies into amazing topics of conversation where the correspondents appealed to active listening and debate, thereby creating a strong learning medium. ",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"I am interested in this project because it falls right in line with my research field I am interested in, which is sensor technology. Through working on this project, it could have many opportunities for applications and subsequently will inform my own ideas for the future of structural health monitoring.

I believe such has the potential to revolutionize the way we see the world around us. Additionally, I am drawn to this opportunity because I strongly believe that I have the abilities— through my experience with Google, my experience as a Curriculum Developer, and my research experiences —to uncover and synthesize, by the means of data visualization, connections that are not always so clear related to this specific project.",Community Air Monitoring Monthly Report,"I am interested in this project because it falls right in line with my research field I am interested in, which is sensor technology.

I started playing volleyball in elementary school, and it was difficult for me since I was always the shortest person on any team. Relegated to to the bench my first two years in high school, I practiced every day and went to every camp and open gym possible. This helped me gain the starting setter position in junior year, and in my senior year I was ranked #13 among all setters in America. 

Another one of my hobbies is chess, and it was through learning about chess engines that I got into machine learning. My first semester at Berkeley has only served to further confirm my interest in data science and machine learning, and I really want to go to graduate school and pursue a career in research so that I can be at the forefront of new data science innovation. 

I also have a healthy appetite for reading and consuming music. I have tried my hand at producing music before, and had a song on Spotify for a bit. I've played the piano since very young, and taught myself violin this past summer.","Through Discovery Research, I hope to gain some valuable research experience that I can build upon in my future pursuit of a career in research. I want to learn more data science knowledge and want to learn the process of conducting research. I'm really interested in linguistics and the linguistic sciences domain, and I found previous years' research on phonetics very interesting, especially the automatic, language-independent phonetic transcription project. I think doing a project in this area of machine learning will help me learn more about NLP and really confirm whether linguistics would be the best application of data science for me.","When I work in a team, I think completely open and honest communication is the most important thing to have. I don't really believe in a partitioning of work, instead I believe that while everyone should be assigned some tasks, everyone should interact and collaborate so that we all understand and can get behind the final product or end goal. In high school and in other team-based projects in the past, I have taken on the responsibility of the project manager, making sure we meet our deadlines, every member understands what they're doing etc. I think I have a big sense of responsibility, so I often try to help team members who are struggling and try to pick up the slack myself. In terms of leading a team, I always try to lead by example, and don't place too much emphasis on titles such as captain or project leader. I think teamwork is essentially a collaboration by equals, so it should be treated that like that - with open communication, trust, and a willingness to help.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"I, like many others of my generation, use a lot of social media. What I've noticed from social media and this availability of such a public forum is that often instead of making communities more inclusive, social media causes people to group themselves together, leading to more extreme ideas and less compromise. I recall reading an article that examined YouTube recommendations, and how the author noticed that the YouTube recommended videos gradually became more extreme in nature as a watcher kept progressing through them. The example was of political videos. Starting with a political debate video led to a video introducing the Republican candidates fo 2016, eventually leading to conspiracy theory videos. I believe stuff like this contribute to the cyberspace being less inclusive and more combative, and I would love to help work on this project to examine this issue more.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"I'm interested in working on something that can help make it easier to apply machine learning methods to unstructured datasets.

I am a fourth year student at Berkeley studying MCB and data science. I am originally from Seoul, but I moved to Michigan when I was 6 and have lived there for a majority of my life. I came to Berkeley as a pre-med student, but took Data 8 and CS61A and have since fallen in love with data science. Although I now study data science, I am still very interested in the health sciences and how data can be utilized in the area of healthcare. Due to the nature of healthcare and medicine, a lot of data is naturally gathered from patients. And I believe that this data can be used to improve and further develop healthcare. Though this is the area of my personal interest, I am excited to learn about how data science can be used in a wide variety of projects to increase efficiency and bring social impact. ","Through the Data Science Discovery program, I wish to gain practical skills, insight into the breadth of data science’s applications, and professional growth. The data science discovery program offers students an opportunity to interact with real datasets and apply what they have learned. I believe this is a way that I can apply the skills I have learned and expand my own knowledge and skills. In addition, from the wide variety of topics and opportunities provided by this program, I wish to gain perspective on how data science can be used in many fields of study. Data science is by nature interdisciplinary, and this program is both a demonstration and an opportunity to display its wide applications. I also believe that the Discovery Research program is a great way to develop professionally. Interacting with students and researchers within the project will give me an opportunity to grow in communication and teamwork skills. In addition, taking part in a project with actual social impact will allow me to further develop my understanding of data and its power within society.","My approach to teamwork can be summarized in three priorities. First and foremost, I believe that frequent and proper communication is key to good teamwork. Without proper communication a team cannot operate with unity. In my own experience, I believe it is very important for each member of a team to ask questions and clarify information as needed in order for tasks to be completed without confusion. Secondly, I believe that everyone in the team should have a duty to complete. Having a task to complete is not only important in the team’s work as a whole, but it also grows a sense of accomplishment and togetherness within the team. As an extension of this priority, I believe all opinions that arise in a team should be respected. A vital part of communicating with each other is listening to each other’s opinions and thoughts. A team member’s opinions are meant to improve performance, so each member has the duty to listen to other opinions and give thoughts in order for the team to grow.
Teamwork is a tool to facilitate the work of many into a bigger accomplishment, and I believe that these priorities will ultimately help reach that goal.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"Although social media as greatly increased the connectedness of people, it is clear that it has also caused much more divisiveness due to anonymity and freedom of expression. And even though many people have the ability to access and speak up online, it is also true that it does not always facilitate open and inclusive discussion. Being from Korea, where anonymity online has poisoned the social media sphere, I am passionate about improving the consequences of non-inclusive speech. I was struck by the recent suicides of young Korean actresses as a result of online hate and judgement, and believe that projects like this one are urgently needed.
I also believe that I would be able to gain skills from this project that are applicable to a wide variety of social impact issues, especially in the usage of social media platforms and the data that are widely available from them. I am interested in how language data and social media trends can be observed, including how inclusive speech evolves with different age groups and the type of platform used. This would be a great way to introduce myself to further research questions such as these.
",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I believe that this project is involved in the very important task of making medical data more useful and easily understandable for doctors and patients. Although electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and blood values are all valuable pieces of information, the combination and interaction between these measurements may be difficult to understand. However, through data analysis, I believe that vital connections between these data could be revealed. With recent experiences with neural nets, I have seen how arbitrary data can be used to learn and create critical trends. 
One example in healthcare I could compare this to is colon cancer and its recent decrease in incidence. In the case of colon cancer, early detection and treatment through colonoscopy has greatly decreased the rate of incidence. I believe that a similar improvement is possible in cardiovascular diseases, that early detection methods using data analysis would be able to vastly decrease incidence. 
I am very interested in the impact of data science in healthcare, and would be excited to learn more about this project and its implications in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.  ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I am interested in this project because it explores how utilizing data science can aid both doctors and patients in healthcare. There is a great amount of data available in healthcare due to the nature of medicine and its evidence-gathering, and this is one way that the data can be validated and used properly to improve the quality of diagnosis that doctors can give and the care that patients receive. I am also strongly motivated by the fact that this project has the goal of supporting minority populations and those that are disproportionately affected by lack of proper information. I believe this is a social impact of high importance, to bring equality to healthcare. Having worked with minority patients before (specifically those with limited English proficiency), I believe that I have the proper background in dealing with confidential information and respecting patients who have unequal access to healthcare.

","Through participating in Discovery Research, I hope to acquire a better understanding of how Data Science and related research creates real world impacts. I anticipate to gain conceptual knowledge on the subjects and data we are working with and to attain exposure to the dynamics of a research group. Most importantly, by actively participating in research and networking with faculty, community partners and fellow Discovery Researchers, I would like to further connect to the Data Science community within UC Berkeley and the larger Bay Area.   ","I believe that teamwork is the efficient combination of many individual ideas to reach one common goal. And while there tends to be a designated leader within the team, everyone must play their part in being alert to problems and propose solutions. Each member must listen to the others and use their own background and experience to contribute to the group’s work and help achieve the common goal. To me, a successful team resembles a fruit salad: each fruit is good on its own but also contributes substantially to the great taste of the salad. ",Data visualization and analytics for off-grid solar in Africa,"I am passionate about our environment and renewable resources. I am excited to combine different analytical tools in order to address the electricity deficit in Africa. If selected for the position, I will bring to the project my knowledge in data analysis and visualization and  my creative, analytical, and collaborative skills. I hope to explore out-of-the-box ideas to create solutions using data which may have been previously overlooked. Currently, I am also deciding what my domain emphasis will be for data science. Working in a lab that uses data science to contribute to positive environmental and societal changes will allow me to gain exposure to the field and help in my decision-making. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"The success of this project would allow for community impact and will bring awareness and attention to the experiences of homeless youth. I am interested in actively participating in a project that would have a positive social influence and improve the lives of others. Working as an academic mentor in Merced, I have seen some of my peers struggle to keep up with academics due to the outside pressure of growing up in a low-income family. I would not want to see them suffer under further pressure of violence and/or homelessness. This project would allow me to make direct social impact by creating a better understanding of the issue of violence experienced by homeless youth and bringing those issues to light. If selected for the project, I will contribute by using my previous social experience and knowledge of data analysis on data with many different spatial and temporal features/characteristics. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"Coming from a public school system in a small town, I have seen and understand many of the intricacies which are used to classify students. I am interested in how much someone’s socio-economic status and other classifiers impacts their achievements (achievements as in those stated by public schools and universities to be achievements). I have often thought about this on my own, and would like to work with a team and a data set to create real concrete results. This project would have a direct social impact, allowing Berkeley Public Schools to create a better system for their students through the results of our data. If selected for the project, I will contribute to this change by applying my own experience with public school system and knowledge in data analysis.

I came into the University as a physics major but to find my horizons greatly expanded with new interests such as macroeconomics, econometrics, and data science courses. Since then, I have completed shifted gears and am now pursuing more experience working with data to solve problems that involve people ( instead of particles or atoms which I thought I was going to be working with when I came in). In particular, the Data 100 class this semester has been extremely exciting and fulfilling by allowing me to see all the tools, models, and manipulations that need to be mastered and used at the disposal of data scientists. I am able to get a glimpse of the complex problems that the age of big data brought upon the world and am excited to join in the envoy of data scientists making more and more utility and insight from these otherwise raw and cold data. 

For me, data science is what I can see myself exploring in the years to come and I am excited to join Discovery research to learn more. However, I recognize that life and human worth is about many more things than just ourselves at school. So, outside of data science, some of my interests include playing tennis, reading economics and political news on The Economist, and read books that expose me to new ideas. ","I see the Discovery Research Program as a tremendous opportunity to broaden my understanding and view of Data Science that extends upon and complements my existing classwork with data. Data science should a very collaborative endeavor and walking through the data science lifecycle (as taught in data 100) is fundamental to the success of the implementation of solutions to a key problem. Through discovery research, I believe I can contribute by working alongside very bright researchers and peers to create models tackle problems that may not have been ever tried before. I appreciate all the tools I've learned in classes like Data 100, but I am excited and optimistic to apply my skills in a setting that is beyond classes in problems that resemble and reflect greater truths in the real world. This is why I want to join Discovery Research.","In my opinion, the approaches regarding teamwork are not a monolith. I think the benefits of working in a team extends beyond merely throwing more bodies at the problem: being in a team is about a mutual growth and symbiotic relationship where every member's contribution is valued. This results in a dynamic setting where the team becomes more than the sum of its parts. For me personally, I like a collaborative, social, and creative team that genuinely care about the problem at hand and everyone feels comfortable to express their opinions and apply their expertise in a position/area that their marginal contribution can be maximized. It is very important that every member team believe in the cause that bounds the team together and regard their own and others' work as valuable and integral for success.

This topic regarding pilots and flight behavior is of particular interest to me because I am curious on how behavior between pilot and pilot deviate during challenging simulations and the factors and features we can consider to study the data. This is an important question to answer because air travel is so prevalent across the world and any mistake in the air can be detrimental to hundreds of lives, especially considering the recent history of airplane accidents, notably the Malaysian airline disappearance and the Boeing 737 Max. I believe I have the technical ingredients to contribute and am excited to hear back from you!",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I am very interested in the description given in this project on Cardiac sensor data. Questions in the field of medicine that require the use of data are something I'd like to work with because my cousin is at the Uniform Services University of the Health Sciences and I feel a slight connection to this project. Medical problems are of dramatic importance to people around the world as innovation in medicine and technology is increasing and I believe it is important to harness the power of data to improve analyses to improve our knowledge on these important diseases: it will do the world much good. I believe I want to take a challenge by potentially being a part of this project and pour my time into studying the dataset and learning more about neural networks.

Growing up, the biggest obstacle I faced was the feeling of not belonging. For most of my time, I felt like I did not belong in this country, and always asked myself what I was even doing here. In junior year of high school I became a mentor for troubled underclassmen. I was assigned two mentees, and although I did not know it then, they were about to change my life. After several talks, the two mentees and myself reached the conclusion that we both felt left out. We three realized that we were all experiencing the same struggle, but to a certain extent. Being paired with these two individuals lit a spark in me that I did not know I had. They helped me discover the passion that I have for helping others. After transitioning to university lifestyle, I found myself feeling disjoint from the student body. The feeling of ""I don't belong here"" was amplified by a thousand. It took a long time for me to break out of that hole, but the lesson that my mentees taught me was always in the back of my head. I was able to utilize the same advice I gave them and apply it to myself. Being able to dig myself out a hole that deep was an excruciating experience. And although Imposter Syndrome is not a phenomenon unique to myself, it helped me understand myself much more and helped me accept myself for who I am. In the same vein, it helped me gain perspective as to what my real motivation in life is: my parents. I came to realize that everything I have done, everything that I am doing, and everything that I am going to do, will be centered around giving back my parents everything they gave to me and so much more. I thank this university for being able to provide me with such an experience.","In the discovery program I hope to gain one of the things I’ve come to realize is most important in the data science industry: experience. Having worked on some individual and some team projects this semester, I have come to appreciate where the bulk of the work is in: data cleaning & exploratory data analysis. Experience is crucial to this field because not only does each dataset vary wildly in its formatting and content, but the domain knowledge needed to perform tasks such as the ones mentioned above varies just as much. In addition, through participation in Discovery Research I hope to become a resource for students who feel underrepresented in the STEM community at UC Berkeley. In the same token, I hope to serve as a role model for students who find themselves in the position I was a year ago: confused and unmotivated. I have a huge passion for making Data Science accessible to all individuals, independent of their background.","My approach to teamwork is simple: constant & clear communication. Being able to accurately and precisely communicate to one’s teammates what is troubling/puzzling oneself is a skill that is crucial to the fluidity of the team. Cultivating a feeling of safety and comfort for all the members in the team is pivotal for this approach. All members of a team must feel comfortable to speak up whenever they feel like they must, for it is counterintuitive for the team when a member thinks/feels that their opinion/point of view is not valued or “not important”.  ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,The opportunity to perform NLP on real data is one that I have been pursuing for quite some time. The deliverable seems to be something that can change a patient's life -- one that can improve the quality of the reports that doctors write.

My parents didn’t encourage academics but rather the importance of working so I could contribute financially. I held two jobs in high school and didn’t develop the proper study techniques needed to succeed in university. I dropped out my first year and didn’t return to school until I moved to San Diego, California when I was 22. In community college I sought out programs such as the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement Program (MESA) so that I could fill my educational gaps and succeed in the independent learning culture of higher education. I completed the rigorous mathematics curriculum at my community college with a 4.0 and transferred to UC Berkeley in fall 2018 as an Applied Mathematics major.
	I became interested in mathematics and data science through my hobby of exploring and researching the Earth Sciences. I continue to be fascinated at how interconnected Earth’s subsystems are. After my education I want to get into Earth analytics where I can use data science to further understand the processes between subsystems and effectively communicate potential impacts on society.
","        I am developing important skills through my data science courses, and I believe participating in a Discovery Research project will continue enhancing my skillset. My class projects have taught me the technical skills to manipulate tables data and build representative visualizations. However, there hasn’t been much room for independent exploration. I aim to build the intuition to develop insights from large datasets that lead to positive impact on the greater community. I seek mentorship and collaboration through the Discovery Program to work on projects that enable me to grow as a future data scientist and as an advocate for improving the human condition. 
	As a graduating senior I also wish to showcase my skills by contributing to a project that I am passionate about. A Discovery project would facilitate my transition from academics to industry because it would show that I can deliver on tasks and communicate the impacts of my work.
","        The most important aspect to a successful collaboration is communication. I set up clear lines of communication between all team members and actively participate in those channels to motivate others to also actively participate. Simply setting up lines of communication, however, is not enough. It’s important to create a positive culture among the team, so members feel comfortable being vulnerable to reach out and ask questions throughout the project cycle. To contribute to this type of environment I act to bring my authentic self, meeting people where they are and treating everyone with respect. 
        In my experience with group work it’s also important to set clear expectations for members. I believe people thrive when they know what is expected of them, further building trust among team members. Like anything in life, expectations may change on a team, so it’s important to be adaptable to meet those changes. This transition in expectations is best facilitated with good communication. A successful team is one where members can teach new skills to others while learning something in return.
",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"        My experience at a California community college shaped my perception on the success of public education in the state. I have a strong foundation in science and mathematics because my education was primarily in Canada, but my peers from underrepresented communities that graduated from public schools in California were not as fortunate. I worked in and outside of the classroom as a Supplemental Instruction (SI) Tutor and quickly identified these students as full of potential but challenged by socioeconomic and cultural issues. Their biggest academic barrier was math; they could not obtain an Associate degree, let alone transfer for a Bachelor degree, without reaching college-level math. Often having to re-take the same remedial math classes, I witnessed students drop out of school altogether. 
	The public system has failed these students. It is apparent they are not set up for success in post-secondary education and beyond. I am unsettled by this and have not been able to walk away from the issue. I would love to work on this project to explore the many questions that I have like, at what stage in a student’s academic path does the gap begin to develop? Are there different ethnic groups that are disproportionately affected? I believe knowing the answer to these questions can help shape future changes to the public education system by targeting students before the gap begins. 
",BEACO2N,"        We are transforming our atmosphere by manipulating the natural carbon cycle. The impacts of this transformation are debated in all spheres of society across the globe. If we can better predict the trends in release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, we can develop more accurate models around the impact of climate change. The BEACO2N project not only aims to understand these trends, but to trace the source of release and ultimately improve the air quality in the greater Bay Area community. 
	I am dedicating my career beyond academics to further improve the human condition, especially for those in underrepresented communities. The potential impacts of a changing climate disproportionately affect these very communities. I am developing important skills in my data science classes like predictive modeling and visualizations that provide insight into the data at hand. I want to build on these skill sets by working on projects that use modeling to improve the communities around me and I believe the BEACO2N project aligns with my personal and professional goals.
",Identifying Electricity Usage & Disconnection Patterns in Disadvantaged Communities,"        I grew up in a Canadian household where money was so tight that instead of using a fridge during the winter, we would place our perishables between the double paned windows of our historically old rental home to save on electricity. I am a child of financial insecurity and understand the profound impact this has in life. I was fortunate enough that my parents were able to pay the bills to keep the heat and electricity flowing in our home. There are, however, many households that are not as fortunate. Families around the nation deal with frequent disruptions to their electricity because they must prioritize other needs, like putting food on the table. 
	I am developing important skills in my data science classes like data manipulation to uncover patterns in datasets, as well as implementing machine learning models for prediction and classification. I am dedicating my career beyond academics to further improve the human condition, especially for those in impoverished and underrepresented communities. This project aligns with my professional goals and will enable me to build on these skills in a way that positively impacts those around me.

Finding a place in a new environment was always challenging but exciting at the same time. I was forced to learn to communicate better with others around me and adapt to my surroundings whenever we moved to a new place. I would always faced with options and decisions when it came to interacting with someone or something. That was when I learned the importance of decision-making. When I moved to New York in the middle of my freshman year, everything seemed alien and unfamiliar. However, my passion for music drove me to start a music community service club. I was afraid to do so at first since everything and everyone were so unfamiliar, but I was glad I was able to make the decision to start the club. It was something that really shaped and changed my experience as a student in high school. Hence, I am interested in how decision-making skills could shape an individual or even more, a whole society. I think it would be very interesting to be able to weigh all the possible options using statistical or analytical skills to provide the best outcome. This way, more people will be able to make the right decision when faced with a variety of different options. Data Science helps humans make better decisions; either quicker decisions or better decisions. Companies invest a lot of money in data science so they could get the right information to make the right decisions.","I want to learn more about data science and how it impacts the real-world.

As a first generation college student, I want to show my parents that their efforts have been worth it and to my sisters that I am a dependable person to them. I chose to major in data science because I’ve always wanted to become a math teacher but at the same time work in the tech field. After taking AP Stats in highschool and CS10 in college, I realized these were my two favorite technical classes and data science seemed to be the perfect combination of them. Outside of classes, I have a work study position as a clerk for the Residential Academic Program. An aspect of this job is creating flyers and posters which I find quite exciting to do. I’ve always been drawn to roles for creating posters such as being the historian of a club in high school and the publicity chair in my hall association here. I think this ties in with data science; the visualization. Like the design of the posters, the plots, graphs and tables in data science are very exciting to create and analyze.","Through the Discovery program I hope to not only develop my skills in data science but also find a deeper appreciation for data science. I feel like I am still underestimating the power that data science has as the projects I’ve done have only been in class or small ones in a club. I also feel a bit lost in the data science community and would love for the Discovery program to help me find my place and where I want to go with data science and how I can use it both academically and personally. In the future I would love to use data science to help under resourced high schools as especially after coming to Berkeley, I realized how my high school and many others are lacking in funds and opportunities and it is great to see how clubs like Anova and PiE are aimed to help them. ","Communication is key to teamwork. It’s about not only sharing your thoughts but asking and listening to others as well. And trying your best to be empathetic with your teammates to understand where their thoughts are coming from and how they are applicable even when they differ from yours. Teamwork is also about being open to constructive criticism as everyone is aiming for the same goal, all feedback is welcome and we should be taking time to understand the reasoning and how we can improve. Another important aspect of teamwork is having a friendly atmosphere. Professionalism is important, but with a friendly working environment, the team will be enjoying their time more and be more open to each other. A lot of ideas come from just casually talking to another.",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"Examining the data of public schools (especially high schools) has been a future goal of mine. My high school is in a small town and most of the students were on free or reduced lunch. Because of this, my high school had several opportunities and programs for the students that helped alleviate their financial burdens such as paying for their AP and SAT tests and hiring a SAT tutor for the 3rd years. However, when it came to teachers many of us found that a lot of the AP teachers were unqualified to teach the AP content. Although they were great teachers in their own field, they had not been well prepared to teach AP as many only taught it because there was no other option for them and there was not another teacher that wanted to and as a result, for these classes, many students scored a 2 or a 1. I used to think that this was the norm, but after coming to Berkeley and looking at wikipedia pages of “well known” high schools, I realized that there are high schools with the majority of their students scoring very high and well throughout the school’s history.  I also saw that although my town had a very small Asian population, usually all the Asians of a class would be at the top. Because this dataset is analyzing through income and ethnicity as well, I want to make some comparisons to my high school and be able to draw conclusions that I can use to shape my understanding of public education in Berkeley and apply it to other places as well. I also found that many clubs on campus sought to give opportunities to high schools in the bay area, especially the under resourced one. I am in Pie whose motto is (“we believe no student should be denied a quality educational experience”) and this motto really stood out to be amongst the competitiveness of the clubs at Berkeley and amongst the differences between the test scores in high schools. Improving public school education is a goal that I would love to work towards. By having this experience to study the data in the achievements of Berkeley’s high schools would tremendously help my understanding of public schools, what I can do to help improve them and what I am able to do in the future for them as well. 
",Data visualization and analytics for off-grid solar in Africa,"When I was first reading the project description, I had no idea that the goal is to solve Africa’s electricity access deficit until I saw it written down below. I then reread the description again and I find that this (the project’s) method is extremely unique to me. The projects I have done in Data8 and Data Science Society don’t seem to really follow this approach so I am quite excited to have found another side in data science! Another aspect that caught my attention is the Facebook AI. In CS61b we learned about AI, so it would be interesting to explore the differences and similarities of AI in computer science versus data science. This project is expanding a lot on not only what I know of data science skill wise, but the applicability of data science. How data science can be used in different events. I’m also interested because as Africa is extremely large in both size and population wise, I want to explore the differences in the different countries and areas of Africa and how electricity access has changed over the years and explore what may have caused those changes (urbanization? nature?). Despite its size, Africa is still a very poor and undeveloped continent and I hope that with this project we will be able to help improve their lives and allow others to see the importance of improving Africa’s electricity access to gain more resources and opportunities. ",Identifying Electricity Usage & Disconnection Patterns in Disadvantaged Communities,"After the multiple PG&E shutoffs, I understand even more about the importance of having electricity. I remember after a shutoff, there was a news article about the death of an elderly man minutes after the shutoff as he was dependent on a machine while sleeping; however, although it was later revealed through an autopsy report that the shutoff was not the cause of his death, this made me realize how serious abnormalities in electricity usage is. I was fortunate that none of the shutoffs affected me; however, there are people and families that have suffered and lost a lot both mentally and financially because of them. Because of social media, a lot of the times we realize the severity of events across the world, but at the same time we underestimate many events as well. During the shutoffs, many of the posts that I saw were about how the school and other programs had backup generators and that many of the students were fine and as a result I found myself thinking that the shutoff was just fine quite a lot. But when I see the posts about those that have been affected; I realize it’s not the same for everyone and the only help I can give is giving shelter and outlets to my friends who have been affected. I’m interested in this project because its topic and content is on electricity usage data; a topic that has been in the minds of the many in the Bay Area. I would love to be apart of a team and come to a conclusion in understanding not only the power outages; but how electricity works differently for EBCE and the potential solutions to lessening the impact of disconnections.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,"Data Scholars, EOP",Through the data001 piazza page and in my data scholars seminar,No,1,1

Overall, my confidence has expanded significantly. As a member of Club Gymnastics, I feel much more confident about my appearance and health. Academically, I’ve discovered a deep interest in programming and the logic behind code through CS10. I now envision a path to pursue computer science and related topics.","First, I want to gain research experience. As a first-year, I have limited experience working on a large-scale project through a university laboratory. The prospect of being active on a research team, especially in a field as fresh and untapped as data science, fills me with excitement. 
Second, I want to expand my interests. As a new student in the field of computing, I don't know exactly what I'm interested in yet. Through Discovery, I see an opportunity to find new areas of study that I can explore. ","In a team, everyone should be equal. That is not to say that everyone has exactly the same skills, specialties, and experiences, but that everyone's ideas should be considered with the same value as everyone else's ideas. I link successful teamwork to Parks and Recreation's Chris Traeger. In his ""microchip"" analogy to a successful system, every part of the system is efficient and equally important, and one ineffective part of the ""chip"" leads to mistakes. On a team, everyone should cooperate and help each other out in a positive manner in order to fully embrace the efficiency of the ""microchip"". ",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"As a person who went to high school in the 2010s, I know first-hand just how much of an effect social media has on people, especially young people. I’ve gone through feelings of FOMO, dopamine rushes from popular posts, and the disappointment of not getting a follow back. Social media platforms can be incredibly toxic, even hateful for some, but their incredible influence can also be used for good. For example, a friend of my friend went missing this past summer. For about three months, his dad made and actively used an Instagram account, “findmaxchung”, that shared Max’s story and resulted in increased sightings of Max around his city. I’m all for the development of social media as a platform for good. In today’s political climate particularly, it’s important to foster a positive online environment. 
	I’m also interested in this project because I simply want to learn. I’m a beginner in the realm of computer science, and I want to develop my skills in computing and data analysis through a real, and relevant, project.",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"In high school, I took a class on US government and politics, and was inspired by my teacher (just for a short while) to pursue a career of policy-making and political advocacy. Although I have since found a love of math and computer science, the class has instilled in me a general yearning to stay educated and updated on issues. I see this research project as an opportunity to witness and take part in the intersection between computer science, data science, and political science. I’m curious as to how such research plays out. 
It goes without saying that the Supreme Court is incredibly important and sets the tone for this nation’s court system. Our own university heralded one of the nation’s greatest Chief Justices, Earl Warren. The decisions made under his Court (Loving v. Virginia, Brown v.

I’m passionate about statistics, environment and agriculture, mental health, and music. Growing up in a diverse family where four languages are spoken and countless fields from medicine to music are practiced, I identify in more than one way as mixed. 
From an early age, I gained an interest in the environment, competing in national events about natural resources and science. This interest evolved and meshed with my passion for solving problems through engineering, hence my major. I also am determined to make data work for good, listening to others' voices when it comes to how their environment is treating them and how my work impacts them. Last year I spent my spring break on a service-learning trip to cities in the Bay Area understanding the concepts of environmental and food justice as they relate to diverse populations here in NorCal, giving context to much of the work I am drawn to. My diverse background gives me a unique way to mix all of these things underlined by a belief that empathy should be placed above all else. 
In my free time, I love hiking, identifying plants and insects, coding, and making music.","I hope that joining Discovery Research will help me figure out what I want to do with my life.
Besides the fact that an opportunity to use data to contribute to a meaningful cause that I deeply care about, I would like to fuel a passion for the domain that I am doing research in. There are so many areas of study, and I love nothing but to mix all my experiences together to create a robust understanding of the world around me, drawing from all disciplines.
The valuable experience of being a Discovery team will let me thrive in an environment that emphasizes teamwork, where I can use my leadership skills to foster a task-oriented but positive atmosphere. At the same time, I have a lot to learn from other who know more than I do and people who are deeply involved in their missions.
I hope to take advantage of every meaningful interaction I have the opportunity to make as part of the Discovery program to help me with my future.","Every team is different and requires a different approach, but universal rules of teamwork include communication, self-awareness, reliability, leadership, and compassion. Working with a small team of students for the nonprofit Mercy Corps last semester, I found myself filling a leadership role that didn't place me above anyone else, yet fostered communication and progress week to week. In meetings I would often ask for everyone's opinions to make sure every voice was heard, while leading the way on next steps to stay on pace. I found that encouraging dialogue and questions was a proactive approach to teamwork. Avoiding mistakes and using any to learn as a whole team means more efficient achievement.
I also found great importance in developing friendships with all my team members, and I believe that a professional rapport combined with a casual environment led to openness between everyone in the team.
I look forward to contributing to a team by setting an example for communication, dependability, and positivity.",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"Last year, through UC Berkeley's Public Service Center, I spent my spring break learning about environmental justice issues in the Bay Area, and I was introduced by San Francisco's Senior Advisor on Environment to the amazing suite of online tools that the City has developed to study spatial patterns of environmental exposures and inequalities. I was inspired by the use of data to uncover structural inequalities across San Francisco, with context behind them, such as the impacts of gentrification and the toxic naval yard at Bayview-Hunters Point.
This semester, I taught myself GIS to understand local patterns of food justice and create a map of Berkeley restaurants and the effects of food delivery apps on food access, which I submitted to the Berkeley Food Justice Mapping Project for my course on agri-food systems.
I also took an eye-opening course entitled ""Global Poverty: Challenges and Hopes,"" increasing my scope on poverty to accompany my research with Mercy Corps on remote sensing tools for smallholder farms in the DRC.
The Environmental Justice Mapping Project would be a perfect experience to translate my experiences to a project looking at poverty and environmental health, and to develop my skills in web development, while utilizing my existing skills like data visualization, GIS, and graphic design. I feel highly motivated to contribute to the understanding of environmental health data accessible by all.",Community Air Monitoring Monthly Report,"Last year, through UC Berkeley's Public Service Center, I spent my spring break learning about environmental justice issues in the Bay Area, and I was introduced by San Francisco's Senior Advisor on Environment to the amazing suite of online tools that the City has developed to study spatial patterns of environmental exposures and inequalities. I was inspired by the use of data to uncover structural inequalities across San Francisco, with context behind them, such as the impacts of gentrification and the toxic naval yard at Bayview-Hunters Point. Air quality is a major area of concern, with 1 in 5 members of the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood developing asthma. Living near oil refineries poses a danger to health, and I see the importance of having data accessible to communities.
I would like to use my skills in data visualization and mapping to bring creativity to this project, developing reports that are not only useful but pleasing to look at and easy to digest. I also understand the importance of listening to the community to help improve this project, as the goal is to make this data interpretable to the people it is describing. This project would give me the opportunity to put my existing knowledge to useful work and also contribute to my community.",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"UC Berkeley is a land-grant institution built on Ohlone lands. As a student, I feel privileged to be able to gain an education here, yet I am reminded of the space that I occupy as a student on this campus. Last year I spent spring break learning in person about local food and environmental justice issues, and for the first time was exposed to the realities of diverse populations in the Bay -- farmers on the Gill Tract who had their ways of life threatened by the University in 2012, marginalized populations living on toxic land in Bayview-Hunters Point due to the military-industrial complex, and Indigenous folks who steward and cultivate what little land they still own. This semester, I took a class entitled ""Sociology and Political Ecology of Agri-Food Systems,"" in which I was exposed to the inequalities rampant in the agri-food system, from labor injustices to environmental discrimination. While I believe my professor treated the topics with amazing competence and sensitivity, I am personally curious to understand how other schools might be working to promote these existing issues in the scope of their coursework and pedagogical methods.

As a result of these experiences, my academic interests lie within the application of data science and other quantitative methods to subject areas such as sustainable development and social equity. More specifically, I am especially passionate about the intersection between environmental justice, economic prosperity, and social fairness. Additionally, as an avid athlete and musician, my passions also include sports, performing arts, and other facets of the entertainment industry. Lastly, as an intern for the Young Entrepreneurs Program of Kansas City (YEP KC) and C2FO, a local fintech startup, I have witnessed the importance of entrepreneurial innovation and the power of technology to transform communities. Data science unifies all of my personal curiosities by providing an avenue to empower decision-making via data-driven outcomes.","My interest in Discovery Research stems from the program’s ability to enrich my semester with an opportunity that amalgamates experience and networking. As an intended data science and economics student at Cal, my interests are wide-ranging. Discovery Research presents a chance to further explore my diverse set of passions as well as an avenue to apply my coursework in classes such as Data 8 and Stat 88 via hands-on, experiential projects. I am especially excited by the possibility to learn from supportive mentors and collaborate with peers to engender meaningful data-driven results. Discovery Research is an opportunity to contribute to a stimulating project while acquiring new skills along the way. Most importantly, Discovery Research offers a wide array of networking possibilities. From school faculty to industry professionals to like-minded peers, I wish to learn from and engage with those involved with the program. Ultimately, I believe that through Discovery Research, I will be able to explore the field of data science and its many applications as well as nourish lasting relationships.","Accumulated from years of working on many different teams, my approach to teamwork is both collaborative and respectful. I believe that an imperative component of teamwork is the facilitation of ideas. If all members of a group are receptive to others’ ideas and criticisms, the entirety of the group will benefit. This level of cooperation is best achieved through effective communication. All team members must feel comfortable and willing to engage with each other. Conversely, I understand the need for an intrinsic hierarchy at times for the purpose of decision-making. However, I maintain that the fundamental intention of working within a team is to learn from and share ideas with teammates. This integral understanding of teamwork holds true from research groups to sports teams and demonstrates the impact of effective teamwork on group success.",Identifying Electricity Usage & Disconnection Patterns in Disadvantaged Communities,"My interest in this project with East Bay Community Energy derives from three major factors: subject matter, learning opportunities, and tangible impact. The topic of electricity usage and disconnection patterns in disadvantaged communities aligns with my personal interests of sustainable environmental/economic development and social equity. The energy sector is of particular interest to me because it plays a significant role in the development of communities and possesses many social nuances, such as the effects of disconnections on disadvantaged areas. In addition to the project material, I am also interested in the work to be done throughout the project timeline. Data visualizations and trend identifications are tasks that I feel comfortable with, but the chance to develop machine learning applications to mitigate future disconnections is something that I wish to further explore. Lastly, I am excited by the potential for my insights to play a role in East Bay Community Energy’s future programs to ensure energy equality.",Assessing Research Usability for Development Practitioners in Southern Africa,"The description of this project immediately caught my attention because it presents a relevant and meaningful distinction to climate change efforts. Instead of focusing on the scientific research of climate change, this project stands out by evaluating the usability of such research. One of my academic curiosities is the application of data science within sustainable development, which this project perfectly matches. Additionally, the project offers many avenues to develop data science skills. From geospatial data analysis to hypothesis testing to mapping the effects of climate on agricultural yields, there is a lot to be accomplished and learned in constituting the described deliverable. By contributing to this project, I hope to improve on pre-existing skills and learn new skills while gaining more knowledge about how climate research affects community development.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"I wish to become involved with the SF-YEAH project because I am interested in addressing a critical social issue while learning new skills along the way.

Firstly, though I plan on majoring in Data Science, it has been a dream of mine to pursue law since the 8th grade. I am highly interested in the Supreme Court and after reading about this project, I truly want to know the answer myself. What is 'important' to the Supreme Court? As someone who spent every Sunday morning of highschool volunteering at a history museum, I would love to see how this definition of 'important' has evolved. Pairing this with data analysis would be a dream come true. I know that if I got a chance to join this project I would never stop working on this because this is something that I am genuinely interested in, for reasons other than academic.  ",Identifying Electricity Usage & Disconnection Patterns in Disadvantaged Communities,"I am interested in this project because it intersects two topics which are always on my mind, wealth inequality and sustainability. I believe it would be extremely useful to examine underprivileged communities and how their electricity varies. It is far too common in our society that underprivileged communities are pushed aside and help is given to those who do not need it as much. I believe this project can help those who actually need it, which makes me excited for the possibility to help work on it. ",NASA data viz,"I am interested in this project because I have always had an intense interest in aviation. While not a pilot myself, it was always a dream of mine to become an aerospace engineer. In fact, had I not come to Cal, I was planning on attending the United States Air Force Academy.

Growing up I never really knew what I wanted to do in my life, so I ended up applying for Biology/Chemistry during college applications. However, after coming to Cal I decided to do something CS or DS related because I never had any experience of the field during high school, so I thought it was cool to study something new.","Honestly, I just want to experience what ""research"" is.

In high school, creating websites greatly increased my curiosity for front-end development and data analytics. I am a creative individual who enjoys being able to see the combination of code manifest into a feasible physical product. Last year, I collaborated with my Girls Who Code team to create a platform to enlighten others about the immigration crisis in America. I’ve learned that technology and design is imperfect and new technology can always be improved or produced to enhance people’s experiences and perceptions. The infinite opportunities of visual design appeals to me, which is why I also dabble in photography and graphic design. I am currently building my foundation knowledge by taking classes such as data science, linear algebra, and design thinking. I find design and technology to be creative outlets that I can utilize to positively impact a variety of disciplines and communities. Above all, the combination of classes I have taken in conjunction with opportunities for social impact have inspired me to continue learning and creating my own projects.","Data 8 was the first technical class that I enrolled in at Berkeley, and one I thoroughly enjoyed due to its versatile curriculum. I hope to utilize the technical and reasoning skills I've obtained in a way that is practical and beneficial to the larger community. The Discovery Program offers me an opportunity to work on meaningful projects that allow me to build and apply my knowledge of hypothesis testing and data analysis. I am curious about the ways that data can be better manipulated to convey impactful results that spark both activism and empathy. I am most intrigued by the expansive opportunities I will have to research topics ranging from women in technology data visualizations and climate change advocacy. As an intended data science and cognitive science double major, I hope to work on a project that not only encompasses these two realms, but will also help me explore their intersection and broader real world connection.","I am a team worker who prioritizes collaboration through empathy and communication. I believe in the importance of understanding my team member’s motivation and goals, and consolidating our shared interests in order to create an environment that is more conducive to our productivity. Understanding the similarities and differences in our style of working can reduce teamwork issues that may arise during crucial stages of a project. I also believe in organization; whether it’s creating a task list or delegating specific roles; to maximize efficiency. My experience as a team member comes from leadership roles which span the public relations coordinator for the American Red Cross to secretary of the Science Olympiad Program. Tasked with finding a way to organize increasing student membership in the Science Olympiad program, I gathered feedback about previous issues in order to devise an innovative solution. I listened to my team’s complaints about a “messy paper system” and “inability to transfer data” to create a spreadsheet template with automatic calculations that could be utilized for keeping track of both member information and attendance. Furthermore, I am a strong advocate of the growth mindset, and believe that problems can be tackled with hard work and effective collaboration. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I am passionate about increasing the representation of women in STEM fields as a women in technology myself. I want to understand why women are discouraged to pursue these fields and take part in devising solutions to mitigate the patterns of disillusionment. It’s not uncommon for me to  question my place in computer science, because less than a third of the students in my engineering classes are female. The sense of community I gain is why I cherish my place in female STEM oriented programs such as NCWIT, Rewriting the Code, and the Association of Women in EECS is why I cherish my place in STEM. Having dabbled in many forms of design including photography and graphic design, I am eager to create data visualizations that seek to help others understand the pattern of participation of women in STEM. I believe we should create empathetic visuals that speak to the community, touching on diverse factors including race, financial background, previous initiative successes, employment statuses, and class statistics. I am curious how the women in STEM community at Berkeley can be further improved and would love to work on a project that employs my interest in design and technology.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"I am curious about the rates of youth homelessness in San Francisco, and would be interested in curating databases that reinforce local and global efforts to address homelessness. The lack of resources that city legislation offers to homeless populations, particularly homeless youth, is appalling. I aim to make a difference in how homelessness is stigmatized and contribute to the creation of more resources for youths in need. I have experience working with geospatial data from my Girls Who Code Project. In a group of five, I created an interactive website with Google Maps API that pinpoints the locations of various restaurants and shelters that offer secure resources for vulnerable and marginalized groups. I believe geospatial data is important for preserving critical information about a location while making data points more visually appealing for the common user to digest. Furthermore, I also believe that the careful use and analysis of data is growing increasingly important in a society where data can be manipulated for either philanthropic or malicious purposes. Making safe resources known to vulnerable youth is crucial and I am eager to work with geospatial data to increase its accessibility. ",Data visualization and analytics for off-grid solar in Africa,"I was actually unaware of the electricity crisis in Africa prior to reading the description of this project. Upon further research, I realized that Africa's electricity access deficit is a pressing issue that still affects millions of people. This is why I believe the careful use and analysis of data is growing increasingly important in a society where data can be manipulated for either philanthropic or malicious purposes. Working with Facebook’s Predictive Grid Map to identify locations in Africa without electricity appeals to me. I believe parsing ""demo"" data is important especially if it can help refine Facebook's technology and contribute to solutions. I have experience with geospatial data from my Girls Who Code Project. I created an interactive website with Google Maps API that pinpoints various locations that provide secure resources for vulnerable groups. I believe geospatial data is important for preserving critical information about a location while making data points more visually appealing for the common user to digest.

I love watching and playing tennis, singing and am super into climate science. When I was a kid, I knew I wanted to pursue a career where I could use Math and be surrounded by numbers all day, every day. When I grew up, I started taking some environmental science classes and learned about the situation we are in. I learned that Delhi was one of the most polluted cities in the world, and if something was not done, the situation could worsen even more. Its rivers, streets and even the air were extremely polluted. This made me realize that I have responsibility towards the environment and to protect it from any harm. I got inclined towards environmental science. Now I wanted to use numbers to save the planet from climate change. And this project will be a step towards making that dream a reality.","The Discovery Research Program will provide me with a platform where I could learn more about the world of data science. It has a variety of interesting projects which are in tandem with my personal goals and career prospects. This will be an amazing opportunity for me to work with real-time environmental datasets. I'd learn the different ways of analyzing different environmental variables. Learning data science techniques in class will be taken to another level, when, through the Discovery Program, I'll work with real companies on real problems in a team-based setting. This will enhance not only my technical skills making me even more valuable as a future candidate but also endow my with teamwork and leadership skills. ","There are two approaches to teamwork:

1. As a leader - A leader is a subset of a team, and I believe a leader should always lead by example. A leader doesn't hold more power than his teammates, but more responsibility and risk. This is why it's extremely important for him/her to encourage his/her teammates to strive towards maximizing their productivity, and this can be accomplished through positive reinforcements. This could even be in the form of informal conversations with the teammates about anything ranging from sports to career prospects. A higher morale, means a more effective and efficient teammate. 

2. As a teammate - One should strive to outdo oneself every single day. Competition with oneself is the best-kind of competition. I believe a teammate should respect their team leader and through their performance, encourage all their teammates to aspire to achieve a similar goal. I feel it is essential to achieve a specific arrangement, wherein each teammate compliments each others' work. This scientific arrangement, build around each and everyones' strengths and weaknesses, will ensure higher productivity of the whole team. ",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"I want to pursue environmental data science as a career. Working on this project with an environmental dataset would help me develop the necessary skills for the same. Moreover, since the project is a bit open-ended, it will give me an opportunity to analyze it in my own way and be innovative with the tools and how I use them. This project requires to formulate a framework or an algorithm that can be used by the company in the foreseeable future to analyze the data themselves. This is something I haven't entirely worked with. Sure, I have carried out projects on algorithms and created games etc. but creating a framework is going to be an interesting challenge that I plan to overcome whilst learning through the process. I am super excited to work with Clarity to help them formulate the right questions (wrt the data) and answer them using the data at hand. ",Community Air Monitoring Monthly Report,"I feel like I have all of the necessary skills needed to pursue this project. I have, in the past, worked with air quality data. I am interested in working on this project primarily because of the long-term goal. I am super interested in learning how to summarize reports, and the best part is that it's going to be used by the Air Watch Bay Area website. This means, that my work will be used for real-world purposes. I am excited about this. Designing data science models is just one part of the job. The main part is to communicate the results, and I feel, through this project, I'd learn this extremely important skill. This will aid me in my future ventures as well. And of course, forecasting or predictive modeling is always fun!",Forecasting Day Ahead Electric Load using a Machine Learning Application and Bottom-up Aggregation of Individual Meters,"For one of my projects, I have worked with alternate sources of energy. For an internship I did, I worked with air quality data but this project is about dealing with electric load data. This will be something new, and I'll learn to process different kinds of data. I am familiar with Machine learning libraries like sklearn and pytorch, but I feel that since this project relies heavily on Machine Learning, I'd be able to learn a lot more. I'll get an exposure to real-time forecasting of demand and supply models. This will prepare me well for industry as these kind of models are generally the ones most of the companies are trying to predict.

Thus, I continued on to take a CS61A at Berkeley over the summer, since my interest in data science has led me to continue broadening my scope of knowledge in both mathematics and data science. With an extensive math background, as well as experience in Python and SQL, I would love to further my skill set through research, as I hope to receive hands-on experience in the field of data science. As an aspiring software engineer and data scientist, I am motivated to perform any tasks that are given to me, even if it means having to self-learn material.
Ever since high school, I had a good foundation in mathematics, which shaped my advanced problem solving skills. Whenever I encountered a challenge, I found the process of solving the problem a very rewarding experience. Recently, I have been intrigued by finance. In particular, I desire to use my mathematical and analytical skills to advise other organizations on financial investment decisions, helping businesses make the most profit. ","Through participating in Discovery Research, I want an opportunity to apply my knowledge gained from my curriculums and get a hands-on experience that may be used in my future career. I hope to gain hands-on experience and expect to apply my theoretical knowledge from my academic curriculum and skills from my other experiences to the real world. I am interested in working on a semester-long project with other people who share the same passion as me and I want to dig deeper in my Data Science passion.
Last semester, I had the privilege to be in Discovery Research and work on a project with Upswot; however, I was disappointed because my team and I were never able to complete the project because of lack of communication with the company. My hope for next semester is to find a project that I am passionate about. I hope that everyone I would be working with in the project will also be near Berkeley, so that we can have in-person meetings, since it is difficult to effectively cooperate together via Google Hangouts or any other online platform.","My approach to teamwork is great communication and listening skills. I believe that the ability for one to get one’s ideas across and listen to other people is the basis of great teamwork. Each member of a team should feel comfortable to speak his or her mind and form a strong bond of mutual trust. Furthermore, although many may consider teams that have any sort of conflict to be bad, I see it as a good thing. This means that each individual in a team has a different idea, which makes the team more diverse; it would be unusual if a team never had conflicts. The ability to resolve conflicts is key. For instance, I was one of the news editors for my high school newspaper. In order for everything to run smoothly, we needed to split up tasks for everyone and have some people take charge. I was in charge of editing the articles of a small group of staff writers and also creating a design layout for one page in the newspaper. Everyone working for the newspaper worked well together because people had good communication skills, listening skills, and whenever there was a conflict, it was quickly resolved since people would talk it out. Working as a team is really beneficial because the team receives different perspectives, which can lead to a productive and interesting conversation. This not only makes the topic more efficient and allows the task to be done in greater detail. Ultimately, I believe that communication is literally the cornerstone of effective teamwork.",Data Enabled Donations,"I am particularly interested in this project because not only would I be creating a web app but I would also be able to help out shelters, which is definitely something I am passionate about. I value giving back to my community, and I believe that this would be an excellent way to do so. In high school, I volunteered at the hospital, performed piano in senior homes, and volunteered at soup kitchens. What I find fascinating about this project is that I will be able to utilize my skills from my curriculum and hopefully be able to create a successful web app that can optimize the supply and demand of physical donations that shelters receive after a disaster. By having this project, I would be both using my skills and also learning new ones, such as machine learning and app development. What drew me to this project was its end goal: to gather data from donation centers to determine how much more money can be given to help shelters following a disaster. I can say with confidence that I would put this app as my priority, especially since it is a topic that I am passionate about.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"I am interested in this project because I believe this is a great way to help youth experiencing homelessness. As a youth myself, I want to help out those who could literally be my age who are homeless and find a way to provide them with as many resources as possible. Since this is also something I personally would want to do, I believe I would place this project as a great priority. To be able to give back to my community is something I am truly passionate about, and it would be amazing to use my own skills learned in my curriculum, along with new skills, to help out. I want to be able to help ensure that young adults my age, or not my age, are safe and protected from any violent activities. Furthermore, all skills required in this project I am at least familiar with, so I would definitely be able to contribute a lot to the project and ensure that it gets completed. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I am especially interested in this project because water is obviously the source of life and it is important that people monitor water purification to ensure that we would always have clean and fresh water to drink. By being part of this project, I am excited to develop an app after researching everything about water and learn more about how to tell if water is fresh or not. Furthermore, I want to develop an app because it would utilize several different skills I have learned in my curriculum, such as Python and SQL. By taking part in this project, I would also be developing an app that would help control a water purification system, which is super fascinating to me. I look forward to work in a lab setting too, since I have never done so before.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Yes, Fall 2019",Upswot (Fall 2019),None,I was in the Discovery Program last semester (Fall 2019).,"Since I do not have hands-on experience with Data Science, I am eager and motivated to utilize what I have learned in my classes and apply it to actual projects.

I was born and raised in Los Angeles and decided to come up to Berkeley to experience NorCal and get away from SoCal. I'm really interested in psychology because I've always been fascinated by human behavior, and I added the data science minor once I started getting into research. I'm currently in two research labs that are centered around psychology, one is researching emotion regulation and the other is researching how work environments affect productivity. I'm also in the Cal Alumni Student Association as the Marketing/Communications Director, leading marketing strategies and branding campaigns for the club, in partnership with the Cal Alumni Association. Aside from school and clubs, I love to explore the city (I love SF!), try new food, go hiking, play sports, and binge watch my favorite shows. ","Through participating in Discovery Research, I really hope to gain more experience with data science and data analysis. In the research labs I'm currently in, my tasks mostly consist of data entry, (some) data cleaning, literature review, and running lab sessions. I haven't had the chance to get deep into data analysis yet, and I would love to gain this experience as well as work alongside a great team who can help me grow in this. I also want to experience research through another lens because the past research I've been a part of has focused on Psychology. I would love to get the chance to branch out and meet more people outside of the Psychology field and to work with them on a Data Science centered project. Discovery Research would give me the perfect opportunity to meet all these goals, as well as help me grow more in my Data Science skills.","I am extremely excited when I get to work in teams. I love bouncing ideas off of other people, working through problems with others, and having the ability to lean on others for help and guidance. There are definitely times when I enjoy working alone, but I find that working in a team is much more fulfilling. Usually when on a team, I make sure that the task for each person is known and that we all are on the same page about what the end goal is. I'm very organized and like things to be planned out, so I schedule meetings with people if the task at hand requires multiple meetings and communicate often with my teammates when the task gets difficult or challenging. Because I'm the Director of Marketing/Communications for CASA, I have learned how to lead a team and how to designate tasks efficiently, communicate effectively, and meet hard deadlines. ",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"I'm a Psychology major with an intended minor in Data Science, and this project seems like the perfect intersection for my two academic interests. I am fascinated by how media is not only constantly updated and changing the world around us, but also how media affects human behavior. I recently studied abroad at Yonsei University in South Korea and took a Media Psychology class. I found the class extremely interesting because of the different theories discussed about how media shapes human behavior, and it also was an extremely relevant topic to be discussed now due to how prevalent and apparent media is in our lives today. I also find this project quite unique in that it's looking at inclusive speech as opposed to hate speech. I think inclusive speech goes unnoticed a lot compared to hate speech, but it may be just as, or even more so, effective than hate speech at affecting people's feelings or behaviors. This project seems like a perfect way for me to explore this interest in media by looking at Cyberspace and inclusive speech, while also giving me experience with data analysis, machine learning, coding, and data science. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I'm currently taking a class this semester about the Psychology of Stigma and Prejudice. This has been one of my favorite classes so far in my Berkeley career because it exposed me to the mechanisms behind stigma and prejudice in several settings, including school settings. We read several papers about achievement gaps in schools and why it happens, whether it's due to a teacher's punitive mindset, the color of the student's skin, the actions of the students, etc. I have grown to really enjoy reading and learning about this specific topic, and this project would help me grow and expand in this interest even more. It would also give me more experience with data science, as well as how psychological mechanisms interact with data science. This project sounds perfect for my interests as a Psychology major and a data science minor, and I would love to have the opportunity to work on it. ",Cal Alumni Association Analysis of Engaged Alumni,"I am currently the Marketing/Communications for the Cal Alumni Student Association, and one of my department's biggest concerns is how to effectively reach alumni so that current students can gain more knowledge from the alumni. It would be the perfect project for me because I am directly in contact with the Cal Alumni Association, so I have some experience with how they outreach and market to alumni. I'm also marketing for CASA and working with my own team to implement marketing strategies for the club. This project would give me the perfect opportunity to intertwine my marketing experience in CASA with data science analytics through this project. It would also prepare me very well for my future career path. I'm currently interested in market research, so learning about how branding and marketing affects participation and compliance of consumers would be an ideal field for me to work in, and this project seems to give me that exact experience because of the connection I have with CASA.

So when the semester began, I tried to explore all the possible options. I continued my passion for math by taking Math 53, took my first coding class, Data 8, and I managed to become a member of two student clubs, the Chinese Finance Club that is career-oriented and the International Family Union, which is an NGO that aimed at helping the transition of international students, and through this I found my passion. In high school, I thought I would major in economics because I was really interested in how the stock market works. I was fascinated by the thought that there might be an underlying pattern in the price movements of the market, and I just have to dig through the noise to find it. After taking Data8, I realized that there is an entire discipline devoted to finding patterns and making predictions, and I immediately fell in love with it. I cannot wait to learn more about the field and apply what I learned to real life. ","Through Discovery, I hope to learn more about what undergraduate research is like, what the expectations for the students are and what I can learn from the experience. My knowledge in the field is extremely limited, and I hope by working in a team and with members that are a lot more experienced and professional than me I can improve my own abilities. Also, I want to apply what I have learned to real life problems, and to make contributions, regardless of how minor they might be, to some larger projects.
","I enjoy working in a team, because I think only through collaboration with others may the optimal results be achieved. I believe it is especially important when beginning a new project to consult with other people to decide upon the general scheme, and then we may divide up the work for individuals, which should be the most efficient method. I have had the opportunities to work with others both in classes (the data 8 projects, for instance) and outside of class (the case competition for my club). In both cases, we consult with each other in the beginning and then divide up the work for individual to work on. Through the process I always keep an open mind for the suggestions that others make for my sections, because I know that problems I am unable to catch might be obvious from others’ perspectives. ",BEACO2N,"I am very interested in the issue of climate change and was really amazed to find a relevant project on it. Also it does not seem to require very advanced skill sets, which is my biggest concern. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I am genuinely interested in public school education, and I would love to apply what I have learned to this field.

While obviously related to data science, this team has allowed me to take a different approach with the data science curriculum at Cal and has enabled me to critique the implications of data science work. Through this team, I have been able to expand the Human Contexts and Ethics component of the data science major. Additionally, I spend my time as the Co-President of the Gates Millennium Scholars Association on campus, where I host social and networking events for scholars on campus and these events are also open to the general Cal community. Being a part of the Human Contexts and Ethics team and the Gates Association has enabled me to pursue my interest in education. Furthermore, I have always had an interest in city planning and architecture, which has influenced me to pursue the Urban Sciences domain emphasis in the Data Science major. I am particularly interested in smart city initiatives and the development of global cities. This past summer I was able to spend a month in Japan where I got to meet with local and government leaders in Kochi, Gifu, Kyoto, and Tokyo to discuss city planning developments in each of these cities. ","I hope to expand my data science skills through Discovery Research, particularly my data cleaning and visualization skills. I want to apply the skills I have learned in class to a project that is related to social good and that intends to make a positive impact on people within education and beyond the field of education. I want to learn how to work with a Discovery partner and how to overcome the challenges that come with working with our partner’s data. I also want to continue practicing working on teams with data science students, because I know that in industry people often work on teams with multiple data scientists and others with different sets of expertise. Furthermore, I want to learn about how data science is applied in different domain areas and in industry. Overall, I hope to establish meaningful professional relationships with the partner I work with and the students I work with. ","My approach to teamwork depends on what type of team I am on and those who are on my team. For instance, in my IEOR 115 class, I was on a team of 8 people where we designed a prototype database for our client. In this team, we organized many meetings to collectively work on tasks that required everyone to make a unanimous decision, such as diagraming the initial database. We also created queries and collected data for the database we were prototyping, so in this case we split up the work by partners and communicated with our respective partners. Then in our meetings we would all present our work to each other and provide feedback to each other. So in this case, much of the teamwork was about setting goals for what we would work on collectively and then doing individual tasks either alone or with a partner within the team. However, for my City Planning 110 class where we did a site analysis of MLK Park in Berkeley, my approach was different due to the schedule of my teammates. Since we visited the site on different days, we coordinated online for who would go on which days and in some cases we were able to visit the site together. We then assigned each other sections to write up for our report and presentation. We then would assign people to look over someone else’s section and in our final meeting we went through everyone’s work once more and rehearsed our presentation. So overall, I have often operated on successful teams where we are able to first collectively make initial design decisions together. Then, especially on larger teams, it has worked best when we delegate specific tasks to people, either individually or working with another teammate, and collectively provide feedback and support to each other when all teammates are present. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I like the mission and goal of this project, because it aligns with the Gates Millennium Scholars program that I am a part of along with the work the Human Contexts and Ethics Team is interested in. Part of the Gates Millennium scholarship mission is to encourage students of color and particularly women of color who are underrepresented in the STEM field to pursue advanced degrees in these fields of study. As a person who identifies as a woman who has recently declared a major in the STEM field and has started to take upper division STEM courses where the gender imbalance has become more noticeable, I am interested in exploring how the involvement of women in the STEM field has changed over time at Cal. Furthermore, I am interested in being a part of a project that allows me to practice and expand my data visualization skills and this project would enable me to do so. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I am interested in pursuing a Masters in Education, so getting to work on a data science program related to education will enable me to gain insight into the work a Masters in Education may entail. This project also aligns with the work the Human Contexts and Ethics team had previously tried to do, where the team had proposed a project over the summer for Data 100 that worked with similar data. Our team wanted to do a project using public school data on standardized test scores throughout California, so being a part of this project would enable me to be involved in work our team was unable to pursue due to other projects. Furthermore, I am also interested in expanding my data visualization skills and this project would enable me to do so. ",Data Visualization for User Experience,"This project would allow me to expand upon my NLP and data visualization skills. In my IEOR class, our team worked with sample data on reviews of our client's business and we used NLP and EDA techniques to see if we could extract any useful information from these reviews for our client. While this part of the project was challenging, I would like another chance to learn more about NLP techniques and to visualize information extracted from texts to allow others to benefit from our analysis.

Working in both the customer service industry as a barista and a kayaking instructor at Cal Adventures, I have  been able to grow as both a student of others, and a teacher to some. In both a fast paced, team-built environment, and a one-on-one shaped private lesson setting, I have learned that to work hard, is something you always keep improving. 

Outside of that I love sports, especially volleyball and soccer, and think they are a great way to stay in shape and help relieve stress. Whereas, having taken art classes since middle school, learning to use watercolor, pastel and acrylic has taught me that to spend weeks on a single painting, is a long but worthwhile task that taught me the best things in life aren't quick nor easy. On a similar note, the same can be said about my music journey. Trained in acoustic guitar, playing instruments has been integral to my life, as it is my favorite creative outlet to express my feelings when alone, but also an incredible communal experience that brings me a lot of joy.","Big data is this word that many use to just throw around and sound smart. But within it encompasses a huge vanguard that I think will define the next century. As larger companies continue to monitor peoples data to better serve their interests, smaller businesses have begun to follow that lead. In a generation where learning from previous information and reapplying it to your field is the only way to stay ahead of your respective competitors, data science is at the forefront of every job market and community.

As an intended computer science major, the skill to be able to manipulate data on a large scale is imperative to be able to get a job, but also make an impact. With relative experience using some of the python extensions that deal with data manipulation, it is only through longer, project-based learning that I believe I can grow in this regard. With meaningful data, and a more clear, goal oriented approach to use these tools to find discoveries that are beneficial in numerous ways, I would like to be a part of this incredible opportunity in the realm of big data.","The key idea when people say teamwork, is multiple people coming together as equals to fulfill a goal. While a noble pursuit, I believe that teamwork is better utilized under a hierarchical structure where those more knowledgable in administration and or the subject take lead, and everyone else fulfills the tasks they are required of. The part that makes someone a team-player, is whether they are willing to get into this mentality that, based on their relative knowledge on a subject to others, are going to step up and lead, or step back, and contribute.

When a group of people are all able to put their full mind into this mentality, a really strong team is formed. This doesn't mean that communication is one-sided, top to bottom. If anything, it must be even stronger from the bottom-up. To help create a safe environment for constructive conversation paired with  a strong backbone of structure that everyone is willing to follow,  and ultimately rely on, is what teamwork means to me. The will to lead, and follow on a situational basis, but never compromise communication or work ethic is how all great things are built. ",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"In an especially heated political climate, the supreme court has a large impact on the modern culture of our government.

I knew that here, amidst the allure of the digitized paradise that is Silicon Valley, I could find real unadulterated paradises: Big Sur, Point Reyes, The Sierra Nevada, and magnificent redwood forests (to name just a few) are all within driving distance of campus. As an Eagle Scout, I know just how to take advantage of these beautiful opportunities: by camping, skiing, and hiking whenever I get the chance. It’s difficult to find me happier than when I’m staring over the endless Pacific with the low orange sun glinting off the water and a sleeping bag waiting for me under the ever-encroaching darkness. 

Back in reality, I’ve filtered that love of nature into a passion for protecting the environment; I’ve chosen “Ecology and the Environment” as my domain emphasis in hopes that the tools I learn can help me combat rising carbon emissions or defend vulnerable landscapes and endangered animals. I’ve also joined Cal’s solar car club and a Decal focusing on self-driving cars because those technologies have the potential to lessen transportation-based carbon emissions. ","To me,  Discovery Research is a 3-fold opportunity. 

First and foremost, I see Discovery Research as a chance for me to reap the benefits of my investment in my education. Simply put, why should I be a data science major if I don’t have a desire to transform my studies into impactful and meaningful work? This program is the perfect time to take my skills out of the classroom and see how strong they really are. Moreover, it would allow me to deal with more rigorous and challenging problems; no longer would I be working with data sets hand-picked by professors in order to produce a previously-established conclusion. Data analysis in the Research Discovery Program seems like the best type of adventure: one without a known destination.

On a similar note, the Discovery Program would allow me to build upon the skills I’ve learned in the classroom and develop a more diverse and well-understood set of skills. This program would be a learning opportunity as much as it is a research opportunity.

Finally, the Discovery Research Program is a chance to continue to develop valuable workplace skills in a setting that values my voice more than an internship. 
","Before this question, I hadn’t spent much time in my life pondering how I approach teamwork. Perhaps that’s because I don’t see it as a chore. Instead, teamwork seems more synonymous with “fun”. What’s better than striving to create something bigger than yourself with people that push you to work harder and go further than you knew you could? That also implies something else about teamwork: it’s rooted in accountability. The team functions best when each member expects and relies on each other member to do their job well, but is willing to help and is understanding when things go wrong. 

Ultimately, my approach to teamwork is simple: First, have fun. You’ll do better work and be happier overall by taking on challenges with a positive attitude while knowing your teammates have your back. Second, lead by example (even if it’s from the back) by being accountable. Everyone on the team should be confident that their hard work won’t be for naught. 

Humbly, I’d like to add that “my approach” seems to work well. In the waning days of my high school career, I was awarded the “Will Newton Award”, presented to the “best teammate as voted by their peers”. ",BEACO2N,"BEACO2N is my top choice of all the Discovery Research Programs because its work combatting greenhouse gasses is exactly the type of work I envisioned for myself when I chose Data Science as my major and ‘Ecology and the Environment’ as my domain emphasis. This meaningful and impactful data analysis is what drives me to learn and engage in the classroom. I want to fight in the battle against rising GHG emissions and the type of data analysis I would be privileged to do for BEACO2N would be the best way for me to get involved in the fight.

Yet that’s not the only attractive part of this Discovery Program opportunity. BEACO2N’s pioneering widespread node technique exemplifies their innovative attitude; when faced with a lack of data in specific areas, the BEACO2N team redefined how they collect data. Now, they have more granularity and specificity and can better address air problems in specific areas. That’s the type of team I’d love to work alongside and learn from and with. 

Finally, I feel I’m qualified for this role (per the Recommended Skills given to me by the Discovery Research Program). I’ve taken data 100 and have pushed myself to use my python, pandas, and seaborn skills outside of class while analyzing messy real-world NBA datasets.

",Forecasting Day Ahead Electric Load using a Machine Learning Application and Bottom-up Aggregation of Individual Meters,"In the Spring of 2018, I took a class here at Berkeley that would change the course of my college career: “Climate Change and the Future of California”. That class scared me, enthused me to change my major, and challenged what I thought I knew about how my generation would combat our expanding greenhouse gas habit. One thing that’s stuck with me almost two years later is how difficult it will be to transition from our system of carbon-intense energy creation to carbon-free energy or renewables. The professors drove this point home: the “duck curve” means renewables won’t be able to entirely replace existing dirty energy without improved storage and forecasting.

	Naturally, the title of this project piqued my interest. If I could help build a Machine Learning solution to better forecast the next day’s electric load, I could play a tangible role in helping spur the adoption of widespread renewables. This is a dream role for me; I can envision how I’d use the ML skills I’ve learned in the classroom (like feature engineering, clustering, and multiple regression) to better forecast electric load and usher in a greener future. 
",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"Candidly, my interest in “Pricing Norms in Cannabis Markets” stems from personal experience asking the same questions I would hope to answer in this research: What causes asymmetries in the market? How can one seller charge significantly less than another for the same flower? What impact do taxes play in consumers’ purchasing decisions between legal and illegal sellers? Most importantly, why am I often unconfident that I’m buying for a fair price? These are all questions I’d like to not only know the answer to, but also be part of the team tasked with discovering the answers. 

	Further, this research interests me because I’m confident in the direct positive benefits of these answers for consumers. More transparency in cannabis markets (i.e. why certain flower is priced a certain way and how its price compares to the prices at other dispensaries) would yield more informed and better off consumers and even potentially a more effective taxing scheme. Moreover, this research could set a powerful precedent for future states (and even the federal government) to follow as new adopters wouldn’t need to guess about how to price and tax cannabis. Being a part of boundary-pushing and impactful research like that is the reason why I decided to study data science at Berkeley.

Attending an international school in Shanghai and moving to the United States for high school and college has challenged me to be consistent in pursuing the things that I love: swimming and art.

While I still pursued these passions in triathlons and other events, I was determined to find out other potential interests in my first two years at U.C. Berkeley. My pursuits ranged from economics to philosophy to computer science! Seeking growth opportunities outside academics as well, I found Berkeley Investment Group (BIG), an investing club on campus. Throughout BIG’s intern program, I downloaded and analyzed trends in various companies’ financial statements, and realized how much I loved data analysis. In BIG, I used these skills to figure out the activities of company management and predict company trajectories. As I understand the importance of data analysis in the background work for a company, I wish to extend these skills past growing money in a fund and be able to use data science to further impact the world.","As the majority of my experience has been in financial analysis, I wish to grow and hone my analytical skills to make a positive change in society at large and explore research as a full time position. I would also like to build connections with my fellow researchers and work with a diverse set of skills towards a common cause. I believe that the Discovery Research program is an excellent, supportive place for me to work on projects that will accomplish these goals.","My idea of an effective team is one that practices open communication and empathy. I have seen that these traits positively feed back into an environment that encourages creative thinking and respect between the team members, as people are comfortable contributing their own ideas as well as receiving critique. When there is conflict, I believe the best practice is to give team members space to reflect on their reasons before speaking and hearing each other out. This is complemented by empathy, as people are able to closely relate over shared experiences, bond over similarities, and learn from each other’s differences. I also believe in a strong relational dynamic regarding beyond just professional matters, where the team offers emotional support for its members throughout life and help each other develop as people.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"I want to work on this project because it aligns with my core value of empathy. To develop my ability to empathize, I dedicate a lot of time relating to people on a deeper level. I began a tradition of having regular apartment dinners with my housemates to slow down, cook together, and laugh about our crazy weeks. Extending these invitations to my neighbors, friends, and fellow club members, I realized these became productive spaces where we could all share our stories, recognize our similarities, and grow closer, not just as friends, but as a human family. My sincere desire is for the internet to have such a productive, supportive community, going beyond censoring hate speech to promoting inclusive speech and empathy for the people on the other side of the screen. I would be beyond thrilled and honored to work on this project because it means so much to me. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I would love to work on this project because I want to contribute to women empowerment in STEM fields. I want to help eradicate gender bias in STEM and further immerse myself in celebrating women’s creative ideas and perspectives that drive innovation. Growing up, my parents didn’t believe that I could be successful in computer science or data science, as they would discourage me from taking computer science classes or applying to tech internships. However, the supportive environment at Berkeley has motivated me to continue exploring STEM fields and developing these passions. Through this project, I hope to create data visualizations that would help persuade and inform department heads to continue encouraging women to participate in tech by giving them more opportunities, such as mentorship.",,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,Piazza,N/A,1,

From narrating ancient legends in my classical dance style to advocating for global public health interventions in high school to researching the barriers to corporate board positions women face today, the perspectives and experiences of people from backgrounds vastly different from my own have always fascinated me. I am extremely grateful to Cal for the opportunity to not only take classes across many disciplines but also dive into data science to weave together stories using datasets and algorithms that approach society’s major issues from diverse standpoints. ","As a fourth year undergraduate who has spent most of her time in classrooms completing all the requirements for two majors, I look forward to gaining experience and insight into working on data science projects outside of the classroom structure. I feel the goals and workflow (as well as resources!) vary immensely in professional spaces and I want to explore and determine what processes work best for me. I also hope to gain more confidence in my technical abilities as I find imposter syndrome creeps into all my my work and affects my comfort with applying for entry level data analyst positions. Most of all, I am looking to meaningfully contribute to a project that has real impact in the world, beyond completing a data science investigation for a grade. I would love to discover how far I can take the skills I have and will continue to learn during this experience.","I tend to appreciate having individual goals within a team with clear delegation of responsibilities while also promoting a collaborative environment where free flow of information, asking questions, and sharing resources is encouraged. In this way, I find everyone on a team is able to both learn and work at their own pace while continuing to ensure consistent progress in fulfilling the group's collective goals. Every person on a team has something to contribute and I find circles where people readily learn from each other and are constantly looking to improve often are the most successful.

Outside of Data Science I am really interested in innovations related to biology. I enjoy reading about new research or recent findings. My mother's career as a psychiatrist got me interested in medical research. Being part of a team is a great feeling. I joined an o-chem research group over a summer that contributed to the literature on the understanding of prostate cancer. My tasks were primarily lab functions and data collection, but that was my first introduction to real data science being applied in the real world to determine causality.
Additionally, this semester I took and engineering economics course and decision analytics course. I want to further these skills through data science research and application of econometric techniques.

This semester I got a lot of real experience with applying the tools learned in each of these classes to real-world data along with some exposure to the start-up world. I have gotten to experience the data cleaning process and statistical analysis as well as machine learning techniques on clinical trial data. I really liked being part of the medical technology space because I felt like it could really make a difference in people's lives.","I hope to be part of a team again. My medical research and involvement on the high school tennis team have made me believe that I excel in primarily group settings. I enjoy mentorship and learning new things. Discovery Research seemed like a good way to take a large step into data science as a whole and apply the things that I've learned in classes. I have been a part of the discovery program for the past 2 semesters, and i'm excited to do even more.","In a group setting, tasks would be partitioned in ways that play to each team member's strengths and interests, but still keep everyone involved in every process to allow for learning and growth. This would involve regular meetings so that everyone is kept up to date. The tasks themselves would be partitioned into smaller goals that could be accomplished in smaller time frames.
This way, the team would be productive, but still give everyone lots of room to grow and learn. Being a part of a team and having a common goal to work towards should make the entire team motivated to do their part well. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I worked on a project using clinical data this last summer as well as a project using eyetrace data to detect multiple sclerosis. I used peak detection with particular features of the eyetrace data to find microsaccades. I found working with patient data to be a very enriching experience because the fact that it was real people behind these numbers made the experience feel very real to me. This made me look forward to accomplishing the goals set for each week as I felt like I was doing would help people.

Because of the experience of working with patient data, I feel I could really contribute to this project. It would be an incredible opportunity to be able to apply the AI and machine learning techniques learned in class to real data in the medical field. The project involving eyetrace data also worked with neural networks so I feel this would really help me expand my knowledge in the area.

However, I learned the major of Data Science at Cal and decided to try Data 8. I gained a sense of accomplishment every time I saw my code running and this experience planted a seed in my mind, encouraging me to know more about this tool and apply it in real life. By participating in URAP with Professor Fuller from Graduate School of Education this first semester, I opened an opportunity for me to use some of the knowledge I learned in class. Joining Optimir Consulting, I found out that data is everywhere and it can be used in any field you are interested in. Discovery allows me to choose a focus with application of data science, which is exactly what I’m looking for.

Besides Data Science, I’m interested in education as well. That’s why I did my URAP under the topic of Universal Pre-K Education. I also contributed in EPIC(Education Practitioners and Innovators of China) by serving fours key guests. Moreover, I’m curious about the origin and use of language, so in addition to speak Chinese and English, I’m also taking Spanish courses right now. ","First and foremost, I hope to develop my research skills. I have done individual research paper in high school about campus isolation and bullying, but I can learn more. Discovery Research offers me a great opportunity to engage in research that I am passionate about.

Furthermore, it’s a great way for me to learn more about data science. I have basic skills to use Python to analyze data and Tableau to visualize data, but that’s not enough and I am eager to absorb more knowledge. I wish to gain a deeper understanding of a field I am interested in, as I indicated before - education or language. Participating in URAP as a research assistant this semester, I learned that doing research is one of the best ways to learn an academic field because it involves live discussions with faculty and peers, and a lot of reading online and offline.

Teamwork is a core skill that people should have. Though having experiences of working in teams both as members and leaders, I believe Discovery Research will continue to develop my ability to work in a team by practicing my communication skills. ","I would like to share a personal challenge for me, which gives me a great lesson of how to collaborate in teams 

Growing up with the emphasis on obedience in Chinese culture, I always followed directions and developed an understanding that leadership is a one-person job; giving out tasks and requiring others to listen. 

This is the principle I first applied when starting my anti-bullying project. However, as time went on, my authoritative style had negative consequences for both me and my teammates. I knew something needed to change. At a leadership training program, I learned a completely different philosophy, one that emphasizes participation and community building instead of hierarchy. 

I began taking time to talk with individuals personally, strengthening our trust and making me more accessible. I learned that giving others a chance to speak up added more innovative ideas to the team. It is important for me to see increased cohesion and unity in a team who I can now call my friends as well. 

While top-down leadership is usually valued, I see the need for a bottom-up approach. Moreover, I understand the importance of working as a team because reaching solutions to problems requires participation from everyone.",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"I’m always curious about the origin and use of language. As an international student, I can speak Chinese and English, but because of my interest in language, I’m also taking Spanish courses right now. I will have a different perspective to look at the world every time I speak in different languages. Listening is an essential part of learning a language, therefore, I am interested in understanding the relationship between acoustics and language as well. 

I am a freshman, but I already took data 8 and learned many skills outside of the classroom, such as Tableau and R. I also use Tableau in my URAP project to achieve data visualization. I am eager to learn more and hope to know more about machine learning in this research. As a responsible and detail-oriented person, I can do the basic data cleaning first and proofread for the team. My love for this project topic motivates me to apply, so I will fully devote myself into it if I get the position. ",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"Having studied in New Zealand, Australia, China and the United States, I developed a passion to understand the field of education better. I wish to know what kind of education policy helps to maximize the potential of students, and more closely, what kind of coursework is most suitable for students. Therefore, I joined URAP project under the topic of Universal Pre-K Program in New York City to look into different scales. For Discovery Research, when I was browsing on the Partner Application, this topic quickly caught my eyes because I believe inequality has a profound impact on one’s education career. 

Participating in the research will definitely solidify my knowledge base. Along with that, I am eager to know more about text analysis in this research. Though I’m a freshman, I already took data 8 and learned many skills outside of the classroom, such as Tableau and R. I also use Tableau in my URAP project to achieve data visualization.

I was lucky enough to have parents that not only pushed me academically, but also gave me the opportunity to explore various other fields. By the age of 17 I had tried painting, was a state ranked saxophone player, and had written and directed various short films. Yes I love math, but I also love art museums and writing scripts. Currently, I dabble in stand up comedy and continue to play the saxophone. 

I think my duality of both the arts and sciences has given me a unique perspective on life. In Jazz, there is no reading from the paper, no following directions. You must improvise, and you must do it well. In standup comedy, one heckler can derail your entire set. You have to be able to think quickly and effectively. I like to apply that strategy to all aspects of my life, helping me advance my critical thinking abilities.
","Ever since I took Data 8, I knew I wanted to pursue Data Science as a career. I love data analysis, probably stemming from my lifelong obsession with sports statistics. The possibilities in Data Science are endless, and I feel like I can help a lot of people. I had a great time in Discovery Research program last semester and want to continue.
","“Talent wins games, but teamwork wins championships.”

To me, teamwork is extremely important. As someone who came from probably the most diverse high school in America, I embrace differing viewpoints. Competition is good, and ideas should be challenged. No one in a team should be afraid to talk or feel like they aren’t contributing. I have the ability to be a leader, but also have the ability to stand in the background if needed. As a basketball player, you have to work together as a team to win, even if you are the best player on the court. I have no problem working in teams and actually prefer them to working alone. 


At times, I truly believe that the internet has gone too far. As the internet has been around my entire existence, it at times seems daunting that nearly all my personal information is available. The internet knows where I am at all times, what I think I want to buy, and even sometimes what I had for food to meal before. I can buy almost anything I want at any time without getting up from my chair. I can send money to my friends, call for ubers, and even get fresh food delivered to my house. The internet can do a lot of good, and it appears that it is becoming almost a necessity. After all, I am applying to this project through the internet, and someone who doesn’t have internet access cannot. However, countries like Kazakhstan and China are closing down internet access for its citizens, and it will be interesting what it does to the economy and their society as a whole. I think this is an amazing project, and would love to be a part of it. 


I have always thought that company performance is based on employee unity and drive, aka the company’s culture and mission statement. This can be seen in Facebook, Google, and many other tech companies that are increasingly employee friendly unlike Wall Street in previous years. Company culture is important, and analyzing culture health and its relation corporate performance is something I would be very interested in researching.",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"I am very interested in the court process, and might even attend law school. This past semester, I worked in the Berkeley School of Law under Professor Rebecca Wexler, researching cutting edge developments in tools to both produce and detect deep fakes, political initiatives surrounding deep fake technology, and related news reports and legal news. We worked first had with attorney's from New York to help find ways to both authenticate and invalidate faked messages, calls, and soon deep fakes.

I created Stem lesson plans using Scratch (coding program) and physical materials for Searles Elementary School for our weekly demos. Additionally, I was a Chemistry and Math ""Mentor,"" meeting 2-3 times a week with students during lunch, teaching younger students study skills, note-taking, and test-taking strategies for Chemistry and Math classes.

In my Sophomore year, I wish I could join interdisciplinary study under data science discovery program to pursue challenges and have fun as a data scientist.
Outside of Data Science, my main academic interest and experience is focused on applied mathematics. I have long-lasting interests on mathematics since primary school, and I keep diving into it and it gradually becomes one important part of my academics. I’ve participated in several High School Mathematical Competitions and I find out my interests on applying mathematical analysis on solving social problems and how applied mathematics can impact our daily life. I remember once I created a mathematical model for high school students in China to decide whether they chose to study abroad or take Gaokao (academic ability test used for college application in China). From this topic, I began researching on some aspects of data that might affect students’ decisions that I never thought about before, and I started realizing that some undiscovered data could actually help us understand one topic more comprehensively and make the model more practical. I and my teammates schemed an parameter, which added several variables involving finance, population, education background for consideration, for evaluation of these two choices and ranked top 5% in whole Nation. I also participate in the DRP Math program in this semester and learn a lot of knowledge and applications of Algebraic topology and Game theory with my graduate student mentor.","I wish to be more engaged in the new domain of data science, to see how different subjects and academic fields could yield sparkles with the power of data science, and to know people who share similiar interests and passion like me. I also wish I could apply what I learned in the university to Discovery Research, which could be seen as a great return for our community, to make future better. ","SInce in Discovery Research we mainly serve as a research assistant, I think my approach to teamwork is to do my best in followership. The followership means to adequately follow the mentor's instruction and not go beyond the boundaries. It requires the research assistant to understand the mentor's assignment and do as the mentor instructs the mentor to do. It also requires the research assistant to ask questions actively and to be responsive to mentor's instruction. For my fellow students, the most important part is to discuss and listen to each other's perspectives. It's significant for us to be on the same page when we are approaching to a collaborated project, and effective communication on the ideas and plans can make the work progress efficiently and smoothly.

",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"Working as an URAP apprentice in a non-profit organization promoting global empathy, I was exposed to so many people’s daily lives around the world. One of the things that interested me most was that from a delicious lamp leg on a middle-class European family’s table to a pot of grains and potato shared by three Asian workers, the quality of food varies a lot mainly because of income differences. Food is one of the most fundamental needs, and it is very important for everyone to have equal access to it. It is indeed very hard to promote the notion of food equity in certain parts of the world, but I believe that it should be better done in the US. 

As a volunteer teaching children simple lessons and an international student who has been exposed to both traditional Asian culture and Western values, I deeply understand how education can change a person’s mind and views. Therefore, I strongly believe in the importance of education in achieving food equity in the US and the coursework provided by schools. I am very excited in applying for this project to not only work on my combined different interests, but also to see where the intersection of education, food justice, and data science can lead to. More importantly, I really want to have the chance to contribute to something more meaningful to the society as a data analyst.

This makes me want to explore more about the diversity of lives and do something to help create equal opportunities for people to access better living conditions. During the power outage a few weeks ago, I understood more about the importance of the maintenance of public infrastructure and I can imagine how lives are going to be changed in Africa because of the off-grid solar. Therefore, I am very excited to apply for this project that can join my interest, academic work, and skillset together, doing something meaningful to the world. I have the experience of working in a startup as a data analyst cleaning and visualizing data using Python and pandas with a team for a semester and developed three course projects using R and ggplot2 over the past five months. I will also be taking an economic demography class next semester to learn more about how economic condition affects the lives of people in certain areas.

One of the reasons I like data science so much is that it allows me to do that in a variety of ways. I love the challenge of figuring out the best way to sift through raw data so that it is easier to work with, and I also really enjoy trying to figure out the best way to present the results of data in a way that is easy to understand, with a consistent messaging framework. My other academic interest of linguistics also allows me to explore methodology. We learn consistent ways to describe and categorize different aspects of languages around the world, but even with those frameworks to support you, you still need to keep an open mind when encountering a new language. For example, I’ve studied the sentence structures of Karuk (a Native Californian language), and while the syntax concepts I learned in class helped me approach the words I was reading, I still had to accept a way of organizing the sentence that was completely different from what I had learned for English in order to understand Karuk sentence structure.","I’m really hoping that the Data Science Discovery Program will allow me to see how data science is being used outside the classroom.

But beyond seeing new applications of data, I also want the chance to practice and develop my data science skills so that I can both improve them and keep them sharp. I enjoy the opportunity that doing data science gives me to solve problems related to readying data for processing, as well as the chance I get to figure out the most effective way to present results of the data.","Teamwork is vital with any sort of research project. You’re likely to find yourself in a situation where someone else has more knowledge about a particular thing than you do. In that case, I think it’s very important to open a dialog with them to learn more about that topic, and ask if they can apply their expertise in some subject to offer insight on the work you’re doing. It’s important to hear out suggestions made by other members of a team, and even if you don’t agree with a teammate’s suggested course of action, it’s vital to understand their reasoning behind their suggestion, as that in and of itself might illuminate something that needs to be addressed. Additionally, when working in a team, it’s very important to continually keep other members of the team updated on progress being made, and problems being encountered.

Yet, my parents are still not divorced. However, this experience has taught me the importance of communication; if I have a struggle I do not internalize, but use my thoughts and words to work towards solutions and resolve conflicts. Today, I am still working on my relationships with my family. It took time to realize I cannot constantly blame myself for their problems.","During my time at the University of San Francisco( I am a junior transfer), I took an Intro to Data Science in R during my final semester where I fell in love with the subject. I learned skills such as Ggplot, piping, and basic computer programming. Through that, I found it amazing how we  can use computers to optimize efficiently  and provide statistical information that can change peoples lives. This was my first experience with data science. After taking Data 8, 61a, and Stat 88, I want to use this opportunity to apply the skills I learned to a real life project to further develop my skill set and to reflect on whether Data Science is the career I want to pursue.","I started my career as a Sale associate working in Japantown. There, I used my utilized my ability to speak Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, and English to create a multi linguistic environment that was inviting for both my customers and my co workers. Working at a Japanese store, teamwork is essential and highly valued in Japanese culture. In Japan, it is respectable for workers to not stand out to eliminate competition because it discourages teamwork just like my firm. However, l learned that teamwork does not mean that you can’t specialize. I was able to use my talent with languages to help customers and as a team, provide the best experience for our customers. In conclusion, I learned important life skills such as communication, responsibility, and discipline which I hope to bring to my project team.",Data for Social Good,Data science could be used for harm or for good.

I try to pursue these interests mainly through my extracurriculars, and hope that the Discovery Research Program will allow me to merge my interests in data and another one of these areas. ","I hope to gain a better understanding of project development and refine my technical skills. My favorite part of the computer science and data science classes at Berkeley so far has been the projects, and I hope that this program will allow me to work on projects that are most interesting to me. I participated in the program last semester and really enjoyed working with the client (Mercy Corps) and my teammates. I learned about how to code with other people and turn abstract ideas into actionable plans. I also got to learn about Maize crops in sub-Saharan Africa, which was awesome. I look forward to improving my skills further through participating in Discovery Research again next semester.","I enjoy working in teams and know how important fast and effective communication is to move projects forward.

I have some experience using Python for data visualizations and would like to build upon my knowledge of data visualization libraries through producing visuals for users to interact with. I believe that I have an eye for attractive infographics and images, and hope to create clean and understandable visuals to help others understand the data.
",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I attended public school up until high school, when I joined a private boarding high school. Throughout high school, I tutored outstanding underprivileged elementary school students from a neighboring town in math, writing, and art. I noticed large differences in the educational experiences of those who surrounded me in middle school, high school, and in the tutoring program. I am interested in researching the education system because of how inconsistent schooling is for youth from different household incomes and ethnicities. I am interested in using data science to explore the achievement gap in Berkeley Public Schools to quantify and investigate these inconsistencies. I do not have any experience with the Berkeley Public School system, but am interested in seeing how huge income gaps in the Bay Area are reflected in school test results. I have two years of experience with Python and one semester of experience with JavaScript (from my research project last semester using Google Earth Engine). I hope to build upon these skills while also learning d3.

Last fall, we discussed and advocated for U.S. programs relating to food insecurity. Since then, I have been interested in food insecurity and agriculture. During my project last semester for Mercy Corps through the Data Science Discovery Program, I analysed how Maize crop health was changing in the Democratic Republic of Congo due to new agricultural techniques. I learned about the farming system in the D.R.C. and what economic factors were associated with higher crop yield for farmers. I hope to join this project to learn more about how curriculum at land-grant schools address the inequities in food systems.

My parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents had all been born and raised in India. Its heritage was innate in them. I, on the other hand, grew up in California. But my upbringing was Indian, mired in wisdom from the ancients. Throughout my life, I have combined the values of my ancestors with the technological prowess of my adopted home, to materialize the passion that lies within me. 

Throughout my life, I have connected CS with other fields to unlock its capacity to inspire change. I created “Buddy” - a forum-based application, designed for the youth to anonymously share and resolve personal conflicts. It wasn’t large-scale, but my motive was to provide students with a platform to be able to speak their minds freely. My interest was piqued during my internship at Indialends. Although I worked on Android development, I constantly studied how the company made issual of loans and credit cards a more transparent process. It amazed me how something so simple, yet sophisticated, could be implemented through lines of code and the impact it can have on our society. 

That’s been my life. A synergy of beautiful things.","In my senior year, I authored an article on the evolution of money into cryptocurrency. In order to construct the paper, I conducted a thorough research using quantitative and quality analysis regarding the changes in the usage of different forms of money in respect to the world’s economic climate and how cryptocurrency relates to them. The experience was rewarding, as not only did I learn theoretical and practical applications of money, but the project also helped develop an analytical bent of mind to be able to give my own insight into the topic. 

Through the Discovery Research program, I hope to traverse various economic models that could be improved through digitization. One example is the Black-Scholes model. Through analysis of past data, a model was created to predict the effect of economic decisions; however, this failed to predict significant economic situations, including the Global Financial Crisis. It was, however, later inferred that had the dataset used to create the model been expanded, the model would have been far more accurate. As part of the Discovery Research committee, I wish to collaborate with like-minded peers to explore this interdisciplinary and inspire positive socioeconomic change and gain practical hands-on experience. ","Staying back during the weekends was never too big a compromise, if it meant that I could make my schoolmates see a fraction of the wonders that I saw in my favorite subject. After considerable collaborative effort of like-minded peers and several trips to the Principal’s office, I co-founded our school’s programming club. Learning Python, machine learning and data science ran parallel to helping my team members overcome their fear of Computer Science. To be a successful leader and teammate, I had to constantly up my game by updating my existing knowledge as well as by researching new concepts every day. The more I read, the more multifaceted applications I encountered. It was extremely crucial to understand and respect the fact that there are other general and committee members who did not share the same level of knowledge I shared. My goal was to learn from the ones who were more knowledgeable than I was and to teach the ones who were less. It’s important to remember that once I was also in their position. Not only does this ensure me to understand their thought process but also allows me to understand how to explain the concepts to them. What was even more important for me was communication. It was vital to respect their time and effort. Just because we had divided the work for different members, it did not mean our responsibility was limited to just our task. It was important to understand what progress we had made in our respective tasks and whether someone else needed help due to increased workload due to sudden increase in academic stress. Of course nobody could take advantage of this but the flexibility was important.

Coming from a privileged background, I always felt an obligation to give back to communities and groups that did not have access to the same opportunities I did. I had the chance of being a delegate to the United Nations Youth Assembly, where over 500 youth from across the world come together to discuss and propose suggestions on how to tackle the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Coming to Berkeley, I joined the data science scholars, looking for a close-knit diverse community, since I was the only girl in my robotics team in high school and often the only girl in any upper level science classes. In the future, I hope to go to law school, particularly focused on data ethics and privacy law. 

Outside of data science, I'm incredibly interested in economic, policy, and law. In particular, I hope to study how technology and data has impacted and requires new privacy laws and policy to be created as well its implications on basic everyday actions such as economic or monetary transactions. 

I'm incredibly passionate about doing social impact work, especially in the sectors of education and access to technology. I am the logistics coordinator for Asha for Education Berkeley, a club that works to provide educational opportunities to impoverished schools in India. I am also on UC Berkeley Model United Nations, where I have the opportunity to travel and compete in collegiate Model UN simulations on a variety of topics and moments in history. Along with this, I'm part of the team that plans and hosts the collegiate Model UN conference in San Francisco every March for delegates from across the world. In the future, I hope to go to law school studying data and privacy laws as well as those implications on human rights and the global economy. ","Working on a machine learning team for the US Department of Transportation this summer introduced me to the usage of data science to transform the transportation sector as I worked on a project that was trying to create a convolutional neural network model that would detect railroad grade crossing violations by pedestrians and vehicles. Data science is applicable across so many domains, and I hope to explore another sector of applicability through the Discovery Research Program. In my past two semesters in the data scholars program, I established foundational skills, networked with faculty and industry, and learned about the existing research, tools, and opportunities in data science. This semester, in addition to the discovery seminar, this research will allow me to apply and build my data science toolkit. Understanding, assisting, and processing the implementation of the tools I learned about in research or industry will inspire me to continue to pursue new avenues of data. ","To me, teamwork can take place in many forms. I prefer to work in a team that is incredibly organized in the responsibilities that need to be completed but also flexible in the way and time the work is done. Teamwork is acknowledging that everyone has a distinct set of strengths and using and building on those to be the most productive and collaborative. ",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"In our increasingly polarizing environment, the cases selected by and decided upon by the Supreme Court have significant impact on society today.

I would love to work on this project not only to assist and learn from this whole process but also use the findings to continue to investigate and look more into law and norms across the globe. It is perfect combination of utilizing data science for positive social impact in the legal or economic sector. I also love writing, specifically writing about pertinent ethical issues in data science. Along with my legal and ethical interest, this project will build my technical capabilities, where I will have the opportunity to work with a unique dataset and implement new python libraries to analyze the results. ",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"Today, as the internet and technology becomes widely obtainable and its uses increasing every second, it is essential to consider the potential threats or harms that it could produce. At the same time, certain places are placing barriers to this information and data, becoming a threat to the right to information. This project intersects data and law, something that I'm incredibly passionate about doing. I would love to work on this project not only to assist and learn from this whole process but also use the findings to continue to investigate and look more into data/internet law and norms across the globe. It is perfect combination of utilizing data science for positive social impact in the legal or economic sector. In particular, this project looks to make the online realm a safer space and engages with the ideas of the rights and ethics of people's responsibilities when participating in online platforms. I also love writing, specifically writing about pertinent ethical issues in data science. Along with my legal and ethical interest, this project will build my technical capabilities, where I will have the chance to work on combining data science libraries with visualization and algorithmic tools.

Before coming to Berkeley, I had the preconceived notion that computer related jobs are all boring and tedious. But once I attended Berkeley and took some introductory classes in computer science and data science (CS61A and Data 8), I realized how exciting coding and data analysis can be. Data 8, especially, made me fall in love with data science. I enjoyed how seamlessly the class had blended statistical concepts with computer science techniques. It is thanks to Data 8 that I am pursuing a possible career in Data Science. 

Outside of my classes, I enjoy teaching. I have been lab assistants for both Data 8 and CS 61A. In addition, I am the Curriculum Lead for Girls Teaching Girls to Code (GTC) at Berkeley, where I organize activities, workshops, and other events to inspire high school girls to pursue a future in Computer Science and Engineering.
","In both Data 8 and Data 100, we often complete projects and homework that give us glimpses of different possible ways data science can be used in the real world. I still remember the Movie Classifier Project from Data 8, where we used K Nearest Neighbor to classify movies as either romance or action. It was the first time I saw a machine learning algorithm in action. While I enjoy the experience I have gained from the data science classes I took, the exercises we did were always accompanied by instructions to guide us through every step. Through participating in Discovery Research, I hope to apply what I have learned in the classroom to outside projects that pique my interests and challenge my abilities, allow me to make independent decisions, build up new skills, and explore new ways that data would be used more effectively.
","Being in a team is all about coordination and planning. For me, I like to act as the organizer for the team. Usually, I start a group project by finding out what each member’s strengths and weaknesses are. Then, we would ideally split the work
up based on each person’s specialty.  I believe that knowing each member’s strength and using that to the benefit of the project can not only minimize the amount of work each person needs to do, but also improve the quality of the
finalized work. Next, I would create a timeline that includes tentative short term and long term deadlines/goals. Once everyone is comfortable with the schedule, we would disperse and work in smaller groups or individually. While working separately, it is important to keep up with each other. Personally, I like to meet up with teammates in person and exchange progress. I have found this is a good way to get feedback on individual work, help each other get through possible issues or problems, and make sure that everyone is comfortable with his/her workload. Ultimately, I think balancing group work with individual efforts is what makes for a great teamwork.",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"This project engages me as what is described in the research reminds me of my grandmother. I lost my grandmother to cancer in May of this year. For several years, she had been through numerous examinations and tests, yet she was identified as a cancer patient only two months before she passed. Because of the late diagnosis, she missed the best time window for treatment. If AI was utilized at that time to compare the actual pathology reports with industry standards and a signal of missing information was sent to the physician treating my grandmother, maybe she could still be here today. I hope that by becoming a part of this project, I can help improve other people’s chances of getting the necessary treatment to beat cancer.  

Another reason why I am interested in this project is its nuanced way of using machine learning techniques and AI to help medical professionals improve their work. I have always wanted to become a part of the Health industry. This project would not only challenge my abilities but also provide me with a platform of hands-on experience to tackle real world problems.
",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"I am interested in this research because I want to explore new ways machine learning techniques can be applied in the real world. This semester, I took Principles and Techniques in Data Science, a course that introduced me to several algorithms for machine learning methods including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, clustering techniques, and some ensemble methods. Now I am eager to apply what I have learned in the classroom to an outside research project with real problems while gaining additional knowledge from people of different backgrounds. In my classes and internships, I have mostly dealt with semi-structured or structured data sets from a business or social science standpoint, which is why I think this project can provide me with a new understanding of data science and how to use the techniques I learned in class on unstructured data sets. Overall, I think this would be a good opportunity to not only test my knowledge of machine learning but also teach me machine learning techniques that can’t be learned in a classroom setting.  
",Computational Analysis of Charter School Identities and Stratification,"I am interested in this research because I think this is an intriguing question to analyze. As someone who has been in private and public schools, charter schools have always been a mystery to me. Like private schools, charter schools are independently run and can be selective when it comes to their students, and like public schools, they are funded by the government. To me, this is a rather strange and dangerous combination as not only can these schools benefit from tax money, they also have control over the demography of their student population. I am strongly against discrimination, especially in the education system, which is why I think the research question for this project is so important.  

I have several semesters of experience using Python and R in classes and internships. In addition, I am familiar with web-scraping libraries including Scrapy and Beautiful Soup as well as many statistical models. Overall, I believe this research opportunity can test my knowledge of data analysis and challenge me to apply what I have learned in the classroom setting to a real world problem.

Therefore, in the first year of college, I concentrated on learning computer science foundations including algorithms, data structures, and Math, and then joined the honor society, where I learned web development as a developer for official website. 

When I took Data 100, I was exposed to the workflow of data scientists and found data science technologies very powerful and inspiring, which aroused my interest to explore deeper. Therefore, I decided to have interned as data scientist last summer. My job was to design database anomaly detection solutions with machine learning models. In the process, I effectively extended my skillset and understanding of machine learning. Internship experiences also inspired me that data science can be applied in many more fields that I thought. In the future, I’m to explore the application of data science in some interesting topics such as robotics, environmental science and so forth.

However, coding and data cannot define me. I’m also enthusiastic about music. I play the guitar and sometimes write original songs when I’m not coding or training models.","First of all, while contributing meaningful work to an organization, I aim to grow to become a professional data scientist in the following aspects:

1. Develop a mindset to solve real-world problems. Industrial problems require me much more than data science knowledge but also the capabilities of researching, designing, and global thinking, which I can hardly improve in most courses.

2. Pick up new skills and techniques through project-based learning. There are many tools and libraries I’ve never used before. Discovery Research provides me a good chance to learn up-to-date technologies and extend my skill set.

3. By working on a team, I wish to put my communication and teamwork skills into a test. I’ve finished a lot of solo projects, but for larger projects, I need to cooperate efficiently with my colleagues. I also believe that I’ll construct some meaningful friendships in the process.

In a word, I want to participate in Discovery Research because some of the projects attract me a lot, so I wish I can contribute to a project and solve the problem. Along the way to the goal of project success, I wish to have myself ready to be a professional data scientist to the industry.

","In general, when I work on a team, I'd like to take initiatives and try to make my teammates accountable by organizing weekly group discussions and set short term and long term goals to ensure the progress of the project.

For the last two months, I’ve been working on a website on a team of four members. We are always busy with courses and in different places during vacation. For more efficient communication, we make sure that we have a meeting of about 2 hours no matter how busy we are. The project starts with my idea, so, besides coding, I also work as a designer that decides what functions we should have and what our website should be like. As a matter of fact, none of us has many professional experiences before, so we are basically learning by doing. We make important decisions on meetings, for example, the framework we use and the structure of our database. We use the MVC framework(Laravel), so it’s not easy to divide the work by front-end and back-end. Instead, we divide the coding task by functions and webpages. To make the work clear and definite, we use different branches for different functions on Github. To overcome procrastination, we set a deadline for each other and urges each other to finish each task on time. Inevitably there are differences in perspectives, but we are all open and honest, so we can always reach an agreement through further research and discussion. ",Data Visualization for User Experience,"This project interests me because it proposes the application of data science technology on a topic that I’m enthusiastic about — user experiences. Based on my experiences and skillset, I believe that I will be a good fit for this project.

First of all, I’d like to talk about my vision for this project.
I believe we need data science for scalable user experiences.
Last year, I took part in the Google Cloud PM case competition, where I was in charge of the UI/UX part of our product. I designed a clean and intuitive interface and showed several application scenarios in our pitch. We won the first prize eventually, but I still have questions unsolved. How should I know my UX design is great or not? Traditional UX design is basically designer-oriented. A designer is professional but subjective. I’m thinking about improving the user-experiences by the feedbacks and usage records of users, in other words, drawing insights from data. This is what I see form this project. we can leverage data visualization and NLP techniques to make value from unused and unintelligible records and text to improve user experiences in a more objective and smarter way.

Besides the enthusiasm, I’m also familiar with the required skills, and have industrial experiences in data sciences. I’m sure I can make a meaningful contribution to this project.",Kiwibot delivery robots,"This project interests me because when I see the description, I can expect that predicting the delivery time with machine learning technologies will essentially improve user experiences. Based on my experiences and skillset, I believe that I will be a good fit for this project.

I’m interested in machine learning algorithms with time series. This summer, when I worked as a data scientist intern at a company in AI operation, I implemented a framework to diagnose straggler slow queries in large scale databases. Combining machine learning models and time series algorithms, the framework analyzes the log files of databases, detects anomalies and estimates reasons for them. The framework helped database analysts remarkably speed up the process optimizing queries and locating underlying problems. Kiwi’s project also aims to extract insights from log files and time series data using data science analysis. I believe my experiences will let me have a better understanding of this problem.

Besides that I believe in the vision of the project, I’m also familiar with the required skills, and industrial experiences in data sciences. I’m sure I can make a meaningful contribution to this project, and hope we will have a chance to talk about the solution in detail.",Dispatcher algorithm,"This project interests me because when I see the description, I can expect that a good dispatcher algorithm combining with machine learning technologies will essentially improve user experiences. Based on my experiences and skillset, I believe that I will be a good fit for this project.

I’m interested in designing effective algorithms. In the course of Advanced Algorithms, I worked on a personal project to solve the problems of looking for lost Kiwi bots. The algorithm located and called back all lost bots based on the information provided by students. Mt solution integrates graph theory and probability, and eventually got the top 5% in class. In my point of view, this kiwi campus project is very similar to the course project.  I believe my experiences will let me have a better understanding of this problem.

Besides that I believe in the vision of the project, I’m also familiar with the required skills, and industrial experiences in data sciences. I’m sure I can make a meaningful contribution to this project, and hope we will have a chance to talk about the solution in detail.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,no,no,None,friend,no,1,

When I first entered Berkeley as a freshman in the College of Natural Resources with an undeclared major, I took all sorts of classes to find the one thing that piqued my interest and challenged me. It only took a couple weeks to find out that Berkeley itself was challenging, but I still had yet to find something that I was passionate about. After a flurry of math, statistics, psychology, and other breadth courses, I took my first computer science class in CS10. The release of the new data science major was only great timing for my academic pursuits as I continued to delve deeper into this field, hungry, taking relevant courses such as Data Mining and Analytics to satisfy my desire to learn what it is data science had to offer. Lastly, my most recent summer internship as an analytics intern at Mediacom LA broadened my views on the wide variety of aspects data science encompasses, especially in data visualization and analysis in the context of media.","After completing the final deliverable for Discovery Research this past fall semester, Arlo came around evaluating each team and invited us to apply again for the upcoming Spring semester. At first I was hesitant because of the poor experience I had working with Elin.ai, but looking back to my former self when I first applied for Discovery Research, I joined because I was ready to take on new challenges. My curiosity for unfamiliarity and eagerness to learn new things is what initially drew me to Discovery. I still have the same curiosity and eagerness; however, as I write my application to be a team lead for a project, I have a newfound motivation for myself that aims to prove to myself that my pursuit of a data science degree at Berkeley truly means something. Not reaching the potential of the project working with Elin.ai this past fall, only makes me want to try again and work to produce a more satisfying final deliverable than I could before.","Communication is an obvious trait to a successful project and teamwork, but my key factors that make up such communication are humility to learning, receptivity to feedback, goal-oriented collaboration, and the tenacity to follow through and follow up. Whether it be a team member, team lead, or even a project coordinator, I think a humble yet motivated attitude is important for growth. Receptivity to feedback is similar because an open mind and humble attitude allows people to learn from their mistakes and adapt to accomplish a goal. When people are receptive to others’ feedback it allows for constructive collaboration with a focus on a collective goal, where ego and self gain falter. Lastly, following through on scheduled/planned actions and following up with finished tasks is the glue that holds communication together with trust. The ability to follow through on a given task is a sign of dependability and following up on a said task allows for clarity, transparency, and understanding of the goal at hand.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"Although ABC Television shows, The Good Doctor or Grey’s Anatomy, don’t provide me with sufficient relevant background knowledge for this project in terms of medicine, they do provide me with a genuine curiosity of how crucial data can be utilized to detect cardiovascular diseases. With various machine learning techniques, neural networks and classifier models, I picked up from my coursework in Data Mining & Analytics, I hope to sharpen my skills and even learn new ones through this project.
",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"Having family members and friends who have dealt with cancer, I find this project hitting close to home. It is disconcerting to hear that biopsies, which are the main source of diagnosis, can be reported on incorrectly and thus cause unimaginable damage. I hope to gain more experience with text analysis NLP and hone my machine learning skills acquired from my coursework in Data Mining & Analytics and work from my previous Discovery project with Elin.ai.",Cal Alumni Association Analysis of Engaged Alumni,"Coming into my final semester here at Berkeley, it occurred to me that I lack a sense of school pride. I never went to any football games, wore Cal apparel, or participated in many campus events. However, I do appreciate the tools, the lessons learned, the friends and colleagues I have made here.

It's only recently that I realized it was not the fields of study in general that fascinated me but the practice of problem solving. While in math and computer science, problem solving is more obvious, I realized that in my passion for my other interests lied in problem solving as well. In chemistry, problem solving was determining how to synthesize a particular drug or how to predict a certain compound through lab tests. In geography, the problem I sought was determining how natural geography influenced human geography. And in finance, I sought an understanding for the factors that influenced a market's health. I'm still not entirely sure what I crave about problem solving. Perhaps it's the adrenaline rush of working towards a solution. Perhaps, instead, it's cherishing that there's always more to be learned, and that the hopeless feeling of being ""stuck"" is more so motivation to use my creativity and find another approach. Whatever the reason, I've realized that problem-solving is not just an invaluable tool, but a recurring and unforgettable experience.","I hope to be able to both apply and learn. I hope to be able to apply the knowledge I currently have to a real-world problem with real-world consequences, whether that's how we predict the spread of air pollution or bettering our prediction of chemical properties in rare and difficult-to-synthesize molecules. Meanwhile, I hope to learn about the area that I'm working in and develop an understanding of machine learning techniques but also about the academic field/industry that my project is part of. The projects that I'm most interested in are areas that have puzzled me in the past and a problem whose solution I'm intellectually invested in. I hope that my journey with the discovery program allows for me to learn but also to create valuable work that has a tangible impact. I think moving from the theoretical model to applicable real-world environments is one of the greatest aspects of data science and I would love to experience this.","I feel like teamwork isn't synonymous with ""group work""--that is, completing work as a group. In it's most efficient sense, I think teamwork is simply the process of group brainstorming and introducing new perspectives. I have found when working on group projects that the most efficient way of learning while also achieving the most progress is through a combination of individual work and group brainstorming. This is why I'm not a supporter of assigning unrelated parts of work to people. For people to be able to get through problems and bounce ideas off each other, each part needs to relate to the whole project and every member needs to have a deep understanding of the project as a whole. In essence, each member needs to have an expert understanding of their part and a fundamental understanding off the whole project. ""Group work"" forces everyone to have an intimate knowledge of every part which is unrealistic whereas completely isolated individual study abstracts the overarching project from the work done by an individual. Teamwork is the balance between the two.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"As someone interested in both chemistry and computer science in high school, I found the idea of digitizing chemical structures fascinating. However, just as the description of this project suggests, there is no simple data structure that allows us to do so. For example, how do we represent a single bond versus a double bond. How about representing tree-like structures seen in many inorganic and organic compounds. What about aromatic rings like benzene that cannot be represented as arrays or trees? The answer to my questions, I later learned, were undirected graphs. There exists software that helps visual complex organic compounds and make simple determinations such as molar mass or density, but still, for so many molecules (organic especially), properties such as specific heat capacity and boiling point remain unknown simply due to the seemingly endless number of possible compounds. We could manually predict these values based on similar compounds and rules that we create, however, as we have discovered, the sheer number of factors that contribute to, say, a molecule's boiling point renders manual predictions incomplete. So, the idea of accurately predicting their properties using machine learning, the goal of this project, seems like an exciting and highly applicable mission. ",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"I'm interested in this project because I'm curious about the results we can find and how those results can spur better public safety. Given that air pollution is such a big threat nowadays, especially so in metropolitan areas, and that unlike precipitation or wind, it's relatively discreet (i.e. those affected by it may not even be aware), studying it's presence in cities could help better predict it's movement and allow officials more time to warn the public. As someone with family in New Delhi, where the air quality index is currently 672 as I write this and where air pollution is the fifth largest cause of death, I have seen first hand how air pollution greatly diminishes the quality of life. If actionable data is found regarding the spread of air pollution, I also think our data could be used to justify greater government intervention in public safety in the form of providing the public with masks, and sheltering the homeless. ",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"I am fascinated about the idea of using the data that exists in audio files to help understand and classify languages. As an ethnic Indian, specifically a Punjabi, I have seen the various dialects and accents that exist within the Punjabi and Hindi language. I am curious to discover whether specific tokens in the acoustic data of these accents and dialects can help distinguish them from one another, and perhaps discover whether extensive urban migration has increased or decreased dialect variation.

Although most days seem to consist of running between classes and ending it with dinner at Crossroads (Ew!), there is so much more to it. Through the morning, I am constantly in battle with ideas as my professors challenge me to think and explore further beyond the plaintive text in the books. By the evening, I would be having passionate conversations with my club members of Financial Literacy and Economic Justice, as we meet to decide more about the clubs activities and our conference held every spring. Finally, I end my day with my friends by having a good-natured laugh as we talk about our day. Throughout the semester, my professors have stretched my intellectual abilities and have inspired me to explore and observe every small detail, while my friends and club activities keep me grounded and focused.","Joining Berkeley, I was focused on pursuing Economics. However, my interactions with seniors pushed to explore different courses on campus, and hence I enrolled in Data 8. Throughout the semester, Data 8 continued to stretch my thinking abilities, and now I feel more confident about how I approach problems. This experience made me realize how opening myself to different opportunities shapes me into a critical and confident thinker. With this same enthusiasm, I want to engage myself in Discovery Research.
Being a part of cutting-edge data research project in intersection with numerous subjects will open doors for exploring data science skills in practicality. Moreover, the projects listed in Discovery Research are so fundamental and impact us significantly, that the opportunity to be a part of them would be a thrilling experience!
","I follow by the quote, “Teamwork makes the dream work.” As a member of different clubs on campus, I am seeing how this quote comes in play. 
For instance, this semester I was a part of the Data Analytics Department for the Chief Financial Officer (ASUC). On a sudden notice through the director, we learnt that the entire department was expected to make presentations using Tableau and none of us had any prior experience with it. However, we divided ourselves into groups of two and distributed our work accordingly. Although each group worked independently on their analysis, there was no form of separation within the department, as we supported and collaborated with each other to complete the tasks. This was possible because of our enthusiasm for exploring data science and improving the student services on campus.
Therefore, I believe that in order to accomplish any task in hand, a team should motivated by their goals and support each other through the work in order to achieve them. Though, there is a clear distinction between the individual tasks, this should not discourage the team from helping one another. 
",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"During my high school, I worked as a volunteer for Bharat Vikas Parishad, an NGO in India. Through the summer, I would travel to different villages in India and, interact with teenagers and their families to raise awareness on different issues that persists within the rural India. Throughout this experience, I interacted with several farmers and truly understood their lifestyles and circumstances. Learning about them, I realized how the Indian Education Board provides its students with absolutely no insight into the lives of those who actually feed our country and the reason why we are able to sustain. I believe this is one of the reasons why it has become extremely easy for people to waste food subconsciously. Therefore, I believe that it is crucial for people, especially students to be have basic knowledge about the agricultural system in general.

Further, this project provides me the opportunity to understand how the universities approach the problem of agricultural higher education and visualize its impacts.

Studying Statistics and Data Science at Berkeley allowed me to do precisely that. Beyond class projects I have been fortunate enough to get plenty of opportunities to hone my machine learning and statistical data analysis skills in internships and a research project. I love learning new concepts and going deeper in different subfields of statistics and machine learning so I plan on attending grad school in the future.

I think it’s a great idea to use machine learning algorithms on blood, ECG and ultrasound data to improve detection of cardiovascular disease. In my opinion using conventional ML algorithms can help in interpretation and identification of new high-risk factors for the disease while deep learning (especially CNNs and LSTMs) can give us much better diagnosis albeit with lower interpretability. This tradeoff is something I would love to explore in this project. I’m especially curious to see if we can use LSTMs for modeling ECG data. I also believe this project would also allow me to hone my skills in training CNNs and object detection algorithms on heart ultrasound data. Another possibility is looking into semi-supervised generative adversarial network models that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data in a generalizable fashion. 

Through my coursework, internships and Kaggle Competitions I have gained a significant amount of experience in effectively applying machine learning approaches to solve wide-ranging problems independently. Most recently, during my summer internship I was tasked with building a support ticket triaging system out of a real-world dataset of customer emails.

This semester, along with my data science coursework I started taking a lot of coursework in design thinking and learned a lot about designing products that are human centered and give people a pleasant user experience. And exercising my brain in a different way through my creative coursework really made me curious about the role of data science in designing human centered products. I was piqued to find out more about how qualitative and quantitative data is used to design products that get people hooked!  As a result,  I have recently gotten interested in the fields of Human Computer Interaction and User experience research, and have been doing a lot of reading in those areas."," Through participating in Discovery Research, I would like to gain an experience of working on a real-world problems that can solved using data science. So far, most of my Data Science experience comes from coursework projects etc. As a result, I believe the the Discovery Research program would give me the experience of working on an actual project, and would also prepare me for a career in Data Science after graduating next summer.","I believe teamwork is a collective effort of a group of people who are all working towards the same goal. As result, I believe that every individual on a team should keep up their commitment as to what part of the project they would like to work on in order to have a finished deliverable by the end. I also believe that communication is the key to teamwork. Sometimes, things don't work out the way they do, and it's fine! But it's important to communicate in order to manage the team's expectations out of you, and be clear on what your responsibilities are.",Data Visualization for User Experience,"Since I’m interested both in the field of Natural Language Processing and Data Visualization, I believe that this project would be a perfect fit for my interests and my building my career trajectory. Through a data mining class I took this semester, I was deeply intrigued by how text can be analyzed in order to churn out a meaningful story that the dataset is telling us. And through a few design thinking classes that I took this semester, I was fascinated by how qualitative and quantitative user data, can be used to better an existing product or build a product that is human centered. So, I strongly believe that the “Data Visualization for User Experience” project will bridge the gap between by two interests, help my build and hone my skills of interest and more importantly, help contribute to the organization!",D3 Data Viz using climate finance data,"As a data science major, I’m used to creating data visualizations with python libraries such as PyPlot, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc. But this winter break, I wanted to explore more platforms through which I could visualize data, and so I  started learning the basics of d3.js. And I believe that the project would really help my hone and build on my d3.js skills, and at the same time advance my data visualization skills!",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I have always been a strong advocate for women in STEM, and this project resounds very closely with that passion of mine.

I've always enjoyed crunching numbers and working with data and deriving conclusions based off said data and would like to build off this interest through teaching, coming up with new content, and working with others who enjoy data science. As I've progressed through classes and extracurricular activities at Cal, the more I desire to gather data and use it in a meaningful way that answers different questions we have and let us understand more about the world in general. Outside of data science, I enjoy playing basketball (played on varsity team in HS) and watching all kinds of sports from swimming to baseball. I'm also interested in photography, cooking, and exploring new places. I'm a big foodie too :)","I wish to primarily build off my knowledge of data processing and analytical skills that I developed when taking both Data8 and Data100 as well as from the many enjoyable projects I've worked on in class or in extracurricular statistics/data science organizations on campus. This is truly this kind of research I want to pursue, and by participating in this program, I can definitely think about my life and the different questions or issues I face in a different light and even provide concrete answers. When doing different projects in data science classes or clubs so far, I feel like the topics and their impact are rather shallow and are designed for one to better their practical skills while not really training their mind to think in new ways. I believe the open-ended nature of Discovery Research will allow us to approach the main prompt from a variety of angles and truly be able to make a difference in other people's lives. The cutting-edge and innovative attributes of these projects particularly drew me in and I hope it will help me think differently about problems from start to end. ","For me, the idea of teamwork is many, many times more valuable and impactful that the work that an individual can do alone. This realization came from personal experiences, such as working with others on a project or even playing basketball with my friends, that allowed different interpersonal skills, such as communication, conflict management, and respect, to flourish and benefit the team as a whole. There will inevitably be disputes among members of a group, especially when different people think their approach will work the best, and I feel that careful discussion here would generate the best ideas and in the end, bring together the people in a group. Good teamwork will allow people to reach their goals the quickest and with the most success along the way. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I'm interested in this project because cancer has personally affected some of the people whom I'm close with and I would love to work with my group to raise awareness or even make a tangible impact on people who have to suffer and battle this disease. I would love to use the knowledge I gained from Data8, Data100, and the personal projects I worked on in the past to analyze the given dataset and create alerts if any of our data is incorrect while adhering to data security protocols. I feel like this project will help fulfill my desire to help others through data science, as I feel like many of the projects I worked on in the past were unfulfilling in this sense. I want to visualize trends of the effect of cancer on different groups of people in various environments and see if we can manage to draw any connections in this sense, which allows us to better predict in which groups of people cancer is more likely to strike. ",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"I'm interested in this project because I'm particularly interested in humans' interaction with Earth and their environment, and the drastic effects that occur as a result, both present and in the future. It seems that recently the air quality, especially in the Bay Area has become worse year by year and I would love to analyze trends in different cities or scenarios and why that would affect the air pollution. I want to use the knowledge I gained from Data8, Data100, and the personal projects I worked on in the past to analyze the given dataset and compare between cities and identify trends that I might be able to generalize. I feel like this project will help fulfill my desire to help others through data science, and have a real world impact on the interaction between humans and their environment. Given this dataset, I figure that there will be many different questions we may research and I want to explore as many as I can and figure out how they are related to each other. I think that it's also cool that we can use data visualization technologies (something I really enjoy using) to visually prepare and see these trends.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"I'm interested in this project because of my curiosity in machine learning, which stemmed from  two classes I took this semester, EE16B and Data100. The description that's posted seems very interesting and I can use many concepts I learned from those classes (such as regression, classification, feature selection, etc...) to build the best model for our given data, which I have experience doing. In general, it seems interesting to recursively better our model through its features and then apply it to outside contexts, such as pharmaceutical or energy related things.

I think the skills attained from the program will help me in future endeavors regarding my career, as well as other opportunities in future research. I also believe that the experience would provide me with an insight into what research entails.  ","I think the best way to approach teamwork is by understanding each other, whether it be socially or in regards to each of our skills. The more we learn about each other can help us to be able to work hard for each other and studies have illustrated this. When a team feels connected they feel inclined to work for each other. Considering the strengths and weakness of those on the team can help to advance the project. On the other hand, also figuring out what an individual may like to research or is willing to learn is also factor aside from strengths and weakness to be considered.  ",Identifying Electricity Usage & Disconnection Patterns in Disadvantaged Communities,"I find this to be quite interesting regarding identifying electrical patterns and supporting underserved communities. I also believe that it could deeply influence the way in which I can choose to help precarious communities abroad in the future with the skills gained.

As a Public Health major, I have studied how critical Supreme Court rulings are in health quality distribution. With the impending court cases that will determine the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act to whether employers can fire individuals on the basis of sexual orientation, we are living in a tumultuous time for health policy and social change. I am interested in researching past decisions on how justices chose court cases and whether there are correlations to the personal histories of justices, the current political climate, or the culture of the times. ",Right Wing Sheriffs,"I am interested in this project because I am fascinated in exploring how the recent polarization in the past few years have influenced our law enforcement, and the roots behind Constitutional Sheriffs. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"I am interested in this project because I am interested in researching social determinants of health, particularly housing and food insecurity.

Using my limited knowledge of programming, I made a small app that informed her the time in her language. From this experience, I saw how easy it was for just one person to use programming to make an impact on others lives. I wanted to gain more knowledge to improve others’ lives. That summer, I worked as an administrative assistant at Carefirst which provides holistic healthcare to seniors. I appreciated their big vision, but one major bottleneck that was holding them back was that they were very disorganized. They had a lot of data, but a lot of it was underutilized and poorly managed. This brought to my attention the potential of data science. The past semester, I worked on a linguistics project as part of the Data Discovery Program because the end product, language-agnostic linguistic transcription, reminded me of the app I made in high school for my grandmother, and it would be helpful in creating things that would help my grandmother. This semester I want to work on things that can more directly impact people’s health and create a positive impact on the world.","I hope that through the Data Discovery program, I can apply what I’ve learned and what I will be learning towards something meaningful, and contribute to making a positive impact on society. I am interested in challenging myself and sharpening my skills by using my knowledge to tackle real world issues. I want to learn from the issues that crop up from actually working on real, messy data rather than the sanitized environment of a classroom.","Everyone has something to contribute, and that working as a team is an excellent opportunity for everyone to learn something. In general, my approach to teamwork is to come to a consensus on the specifications, then divide the tasks among all the team members with consideration of the team needs, individual interests, and individual skills. While working on the tasks, direct everyone to resources so they can learn and perform their task themselves, then finally meet with the group to discuss our progress and difficulties and iterate through the process again.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"Cardiovascular diseases take approximately 18 million lives each year worldwide. Being able to detect and prevent it would be a big help in disease management, having a positive impact to many people. As my mother has heart issues, so I am passionate about learning more on heart diseases as well as contributing to efforts towards their detection.

I definitely think neural networks would be able to classify the diseases. Nevertheless, I’m interested in exploring the use of simpler machine learning models as well, such as logistic regression. All in all, analysis of the data would be necessary to determine the appropriate model to use. I am eager to participate in the discussions it could generate.",Pathologists Cancer Alert,Communication is an underrated aspect of patient care and having complete data available to the right people will do a lot to reduce cancer mortality. This project is very scalable and can be modified for other diseases which will make a great impact on many lives.

Each media allows a person to apply machine learning to a different set of problems. For example, with images, one can solve computer vision problems. With text, the computer can process and analyze natural language data. Being able to apply machine learning to graphs allows us to solve an enormous new set of problems. We can apply machine learning to things that can be represented as a graph such as molecule and crystal structures, flow, social network graphs, linguistic syntax, and so forth. Graph theory touches upon many disciplines so being able to use graphs for machine learning will open many doors.

I’m Chinmay, and I’ve always been excited to use data to understand the world around me. This obsession started in middle school, when I used metrics like OPRK, %ST, and +/- to pick an undefeated fantasy football team. Ever since then, this obsession with data has resulted in unforgettable experiences. By analyzing millions-of-millions of NBA play-by-play data, I was able to meet league executives, players, and popular sports analytics figures at the NBA Hackathon in New Jersey. By looking at correlations between microbiome location and disease, I was exposed to basic research skills through the COSMOS program. Through Discovery Research, I hope to gain even more of these unforgettable experiences.
        Outside of data science, I am interested in geography and large-scale logistics. One of my favorite hobbies is to click a random location on Google Maps and learn about the surrounding cities or landmarks surrounding it. As a result of this, I have learned a lot about the cities, mountains and rivers in the world. In addition, I find large scale efficient transportation systems fascinating. I like learning about rapid Asian subway systems like the Hong Kong MTR, as well as ambitious initiatives such as HyperLoop.
","       Through Discovery Research, I hope to explore meaningful connections between data science and my interests in logistics, transportation, and the environment. As an IEOR major, I am very interested in networks and how people/goods flow between multiple destinations. However, it is hard to explore these connections because of the lack of available data and mentoring on how to interpret this data for analysis. I know that both of these issues can be addressed by working with organizations like East Bay Community Energy and Kiwi Campus. 
	In addition, I hope to learn about new data science technologies and leverage the knowledge from my coursework in a practical manner. Currently, I have never had significant experience working with cloud technologies (e.g. Amazon Web Services) or geospatial libraries/data. I know I can gain meaningful experience in these areas through working with logistics and environment related problems. Last semester, I took an introductory machine learning class as well as a probability class. Although I enjoyed learning the theory behind machine learning and probability, I still crave an opportunity to use this knowledge to answer an actionable problem. For this, the Discovery Research Program is the perfect opportunity. 
","        In terms of teamwork, I believe that a healthy mix of collaboration and individual work is the best way to achieve a given task. I believe individual work is important because it allows everyone to develop their own strategy to solve a task, regardless of how extroverted they are. In terms of collaboration, my ideal working scenario consists of the following steps. First, everyone introduces their strategies to solve a given task, even if a strategy draws clear support from the group in the middle of a discussion. This ensures that all of the participants listen to other perspectives that the group has. The next step is for volunteers to suggest key issues and set deadlines to follow up on these issues. Preferably, a mediator ensures that all issues are discussed according to an order of importance agreed on by a group. After this, everyone collectively delegates tasks to one another and works individually again to solve the problem.",Dispatcher algorithm,"        I am interested in working on the Dispatcher Algorithm project because the project is the perfect intersection of my interests in logistics and working in a high-growth startup. 
	At UC Berkeley, I am an Industrial Engineering and Operations Research(IEOR) major. As an IEOR major, I eagerly explore ways to optimize networks by using statistics, mathematics, and computer science methods. However, I have never had the opportunity to work with a real-life transportation network. Through this opportunity, I know that I can put my IEOR skills to solve a pressing problem for a real organization, and go beyond problems in a textbook. 
	So far, my professional experience has only been at large companies. Although I learned a lot of new skills, I was also shocked by the time it took for the smallest changes to be reviewed and submitted to an actual codebase. As a result, I wanted to experience the work environment of a startup, where I could see the impact of my work more easily. I know that Kiwi can provide this environment, along with the benefit of working with other like-minded students and professionals. 
",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"      I am interested in working on the Clarity Movement project because the project is the perfect combination of working on a critical issue of personal meaning, data science, and the environment of a high-growth startup. 
      As a child, I was unfortunately diagnosed with asthma. However, throughout the course of my childhood, I lessened the severity of my asthma condition by increasing my aerobic activity year by year. Whenever I visited India, my asthma condition would always suddenly decline again. I began to get frustrated at having to wear a mask air and breathe air that would damage my lungs in the same way that smoking 4 packs of cigarettes would. I wanted to fight pollution, but didn’t know how to do so in a meaningful way. By learning about Clarity, I know I can finally take a significant step to solving the pollution problem. 
        In addition to the personal significance that the project has, I am also excited at the opportunity of analyzing sensor and geospatial data that I haven’t had a chance to work with yet. I also look forward  to experiencing the work environment of a startup, where I could see the impact of my work more easily. So far, I have only worked at large companies, where it took a long time for changes to be made in my experience.

about analyzing text as data. I saw some researchers doing influential works in gender studies by analyzing texts from twitter. I was truly inspired by their work. Since then, I want to be in a research team that uses data to make a difference in our society. This project develops a detector for inclusive online speech. I find it interesting because it takes a new perspective on reviewing online speech. It seeks inclusiveness instead of hate speech. I am curious to see how it results differently and I want to be part of team making that result.  ",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"Reading the project description, I was intrigued by the datasets it described.

I grew up in the Outer Richmond district in San Francisco. My pre-collegiate years were largely spent competing as an archer on the national circuit. My academic interests include statistics, mathematics, economics, business, philosophy, and environmental science. During my junior year of high school, I worked as an intern environmental engineer for Shanghai Municipal Investments. It was a very exhilarating opportunity that allowed me to exercise my critical thinking skills and contribute meaningfully towards a good cause. I worked as a team member of Chipotle Mexican Grill the following summer. Upon enrolling here at UC Berkeley, I picked up an interest in historical fencing: a sport that complements archery quite well. Soon, I began to serve as the financial director of both our fencing club and the Aerospace SAE Engineering groups. During my first three semesters here at CAL, I have also devoted a significant amount of time towards the California Actuarial League, where I developed many skills directly related to data science. Last semester, I worked as a consultant for Penji tutoring where our team led a market research campaign and led a WTP survey. 
","I wish to be able to gain hands-on experience working on a data project that will provide real value towards the goals of an organization or group. Through my coursework at Berkeley, I have learned various skills that are applicable to data science. Therefore, an opportunity like participating in Discovery Research would allow me to put what I have learned in the classroom to practical use. By helping to confront the obstacles that researchers face, I can excel beyond my comfort zone and improve as an aspiring data scientist. Additionally, this opportunity would allow me to gain greater insight into the potential applications of data science in different endeavors or in the context of cutting-edge research. The exposure would help me understand what aspects of data science that I might wish to focus on. Finally, it is my hope to gain more experience working in a team setting. 
","I really love teamwork. As an extremely enthusiastic and positive person, my approach to teamwork is to best support my teammates and the project progression to the best of my ability. I very much enjoy strategizing the best way to tackle a project or ways to make certain aspects of our work more efficient. For example, one of the highlights of my time working as an intern environmental engineer was designing a more efficient incinerator conveyor system. Through interacting with and learning about the work that my fellow employees did, I was able to find the sources of inefficiencies. Another example that shows my approach to teamwork was my very first day on the job at Chipotle. The moment I stepped up to the counter, we were swarmed by over fifty customers. Although seemingly counterintuitive, I actually stepped behind the counter and helped restock instead of scooping the food. The logic behind my actions was that since I was a brand new worker, my speed on the food line would be much slower than that of my coworkers so the best way to support the team was actually stepping back and letting more experienced members take charge. 
",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"For my high school philosophy project, I asked over a hundred people about how they would define justice. Out of all the responses, the best one was “justice is when everything receives what they deserve.” And I truly believe that our world is worth protecting. My goal in life is to use my various skills, especially data science skills, in order to protect our environment. I believe that my passion for environmental justice and my past experience would make me a perfect candidate. In my statistics 20 class, my final project was to use R to provide insights and data visualization in the form of a map program for Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. During my time as an intern environmental engineer for Shanghai Environmental Group, I gained a great amount of hands-on exposure to the environmental engineering field and experience working in a team. Next semester I will be taking CS61A, our computer science course that teaches Python. I feel that my background/skills/goals and this project are a perfect match.
",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"When first asked “What do you want to be when you grow up?” as a small child, I responded that I wanted to be a judge. For my entire life, I have held a tremendous respect for the Supreme Court of the United States and an interest in its workings. Recently, I have decided to pursue the data science track instead of law: however, my interest in the American justice system is greater than ever. Studying the changing role of the Supreme Court in AP Government and History 7A class has helped me gain a rudimentary understanding of the nature of the court. However, just like you, I am truly fascinated in the court’s docket and how they prioritize certain cases. I will be taking UC Berkeley’s CS61A course that teaches python and I have a decent amount of work experience through my time as an intern environmental engineer and consultant. I also have made a few projects using both Microsoft Excel and R. I hope to join your team and use my data science skills to help decipher the mystery of the Supreme Court’s docket and understand the underlying factors of how they choose a case to review.
",Assessing Research Usability for Development Practitioners in Southern Africa,"

I would describe myself as being extremely passionate about environmental justice and data science. In the past, I have worked as an intern environmental engineer in Shanghai. However, I am very interested in expanding my horizons and learning more about the usage of new data in South Africa. Through my time in the California Actuarial League, I have learned a great deal about how professionals utilize environmental data in order to better make decisions. As a statistics and data science student, I am also extremely enthusiastic about utilizing code, hypothesis testing, and analysis to complete this project. Previously, I have also created a map project using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Data in our Stat 20 class. Next semester, I will be taking our CS61A class that teaches Python. Many of this project’s topics such as time series data are very fascinating and I would be open to diligently learn. I feel that I would have a lot to contribute and also a lot to gain out of doing this project.

Coming from Singapore, the traditional professions for a top student were medicine and law. Stable professions, good salaries and the comfort of being home lures many Singaporeans. However, I have always believed in the power to create. To me, the ability to possess such a formidable skill means wielding a weapon that’s capable of winning all wars. The art of thinking logically and methodologically has always excited me. As a visual learner, the ability to visualize abstract pieces of information in a way that is easy to understand for the common man enthuses me. It all started when I learned about NumPy, Pandas and Seaborn during an introduction to data science module that I took at the Singapore Data Science Academy. At Cal, I read a book titled “Data Science” by John Keller and Brendan Tierney, which introduced me to the technical jargons of data science and the type of data that is dealt with (numerical, nominal and ordinal). This further solidified my understanding that the type of data affected the methods of analysis that could be employed on analytics records and that the inclusion of unnecessary attributes added to the cost associated with analyzing data. The ability to draw insights to influence key decisions is yet another skill that I want to add to my armamentarium. ","Honing my analytical and critical thinking abilities is of utmost importance to me. I feel that my first semester at Cal was useful in getting me back to think scientifically with an inquisitive mind especially after my two year stint in the military. Computer Science and Engineering are phenomenal tools in developing a problem-solving mindset. However, every Engineer needs a domain to apply his knowledge to. I’m deeply interested in employing Deep Learning (no pun intended) as an instrument to detect heart disease with cardiac sensor data with Dr Tison. The ability to develop and apply sophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms with the goal of achieving personalized cardiovascular prognosis and disease prevention in the field of medicine is mind-blowing. I know this research opportunity in digital cardiology is up my alley because of the synergy of machine learning, engineering, data science and medical research. This will allow me to contribute, develop new skills and push myself out of my comfort zone. In Electrical Engineering 16A, the machine learning module gave me an in-depth understanding of linear regression models and orthogonal matching pursuit. Computer Science 61A gave me a strong foundation in Python and creative thinking. My foundation has been laid, now all I hope to achieve is a greater understanding of deep learning that is at the heart (no pun intended) of the intersection of multifarious fields.","Prior to enrolling at Cal, I was working at a travel startup, BlackBook. I was working in a team, specifically, with the CEO, UI/UX Director, Marketing Director and Chief Technology Officer. As a twenty-one year old who has undergone training in the military, I understand that working in a team is a core part of mission success. Thus, I understand the importance of teamwork at a corporate, strategic and societal level. At BlackBook, I was the only intern to pitch at a national event against CEOs of other companies and was commended for being a “strong and convincing speaker”. Yes, my CEO had that much faith in my abilities that he was willing to put his name on the line while he was away on a business trip. As a leader, I always make an effort to listen to the inputs of others. I am a firm believer that every individual has a unique experience that lends diversity to team discussions. I appreciate the value of teamwork because my past work experiences have led me to experience those ‘Eureka’ moments that lifts the morale of the team. I yearn to relive and recreate those moments once again.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I firmly believe that the true mark of a critical thinker lies in his ability to amalgamate knowledge from a smorgasbord of disciplines and apply that knowledge in novel ways. I greatly admire entrepreneurs like Elon Musk because he is what some would call a “Solid Generalist”. I want to develop myself in a similar regard because of my curiosity in Computer Science and the application of it in the medical industry. I am currently developing my programming, critical thinking and problem solving abilities through the rigorous EECS curriculum at Cal. However, I feel that in order to apply my programming skills to the medical industry, research opportunities like this are just what I need. Through this research project, I would be able to contribute and grow while applying deep learning algorithms to cardiological analytics records. Additionally, I recognize the seriousness of cardiological diseases as a leading cause of death globally and I want to be part of the team that uses Deep Learning to critically analyze and find patterns in current datasets so as to be able to derive insights that can help doctors in ensuring early prevention of such life-threatening cardiac diseases. ",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"
The quality of the air we breathe in perhaps one of the most hotly debated topics of our time. Many countries like India and China have gone as far as banning festivals such as Deepavali that caused widespread air pollution during the festive season. Given the importance of air quality in influencing the quality of life for the common man, being part of this research project will enable me to contribute to a cause bigger than myself. There can be no better time than now for the analysis of big datasets that deal with the monitoring of air quality in a major city. Some of the crucial questions to answer in this project will be - is air pollution seasonal? Is it possible to identify months in a year where average air pollution is significantly higher than the other times in the year? Is there a relationship between temperature and air pollution? Does the distribution of factories within the area impact the quality of air and if it does, what is the significance of the difference between areas with factories and those without? I look forward to discussing ideas and collaborating with the team to better identify and create an appropriate model to automate reports while categorizing and analyzing nominal and numeric data. 
",NASA data viz,"With the recent spate of the mysterious disappearance of flights, the airline industry’s emphasis on flight safety and the historical fundamental role of pilots in ensuring that those onboard have a good experience, analyzing the flight behavior of pilots is as important as it can ever be. I think it is of utmost importance to gauge and determine the attention span and dexterity of pilots on simulation flights through tracking their eye movements and fixation periods. I believe that I am the man for the job as I know that my analytical and critical thinking skills would enable me to think flexibly while discussing and deciding which features of different datasets can be aptly combined to yield derived data that grants crucial insights in understanding a pilot’s behavior. Additionally, I am more than willing to explore creative ways of displaying the coordinates of eye fixations on the display and to work on software that can replay the state of the simulator. I look forward to meeting the team to better understand their requirements and vision for this project. ",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,N/A,N/A,Computer Science Scholars,URAP Spring 2020 Open Projects,N/A,1,

I am hoping to pursue a degree in Data Science with a concentration in Computational Biology, and I plan to work in Bioinformatics after college. However, I would like to explore many different aspects of Data Science while attending Berkeley. I hope to take classes on the financial, economic, social and business applications of Data Science as well. Outside of Data Science, some of the most rewarding experiences of my life so far have been my 2 research internships that I completed in high school. Both of them were based on marine science, and I would love to explore the topic even more.","I hope to work on a project that I am very passionate about and that I can be proud of.

Throughout high school I played saxophone in every band that I could join, from wind ensemble, to jazz band, to marching band, to even a saxophone quartet. I was constantly excited to play more, to learn new styles, and to improve. Being a musician taught me many important lessons. Though cliche, practicing music requires discipline and hard work. In high school I would skip lunches, or spend my study hall locked up in a practice room to drill my pieces, practicing upwards of 2 hours each day. I would strictly adhere to a procedure each practice session in order to optimize my improvement. Through this consistent effort, I felt myself grow to greater heights. Music has also fostered my attention to detail. Whether it be noticing a slight angle of error in my hand position along the saxophone, or an incorrect pitch of a note, every detail mattered in honing my musicality. Lastly, I believe music has taught me creativity. Music, is a boundless form of expression, and as a musician you have to learn how to embrace subjectivity. Especially as a jazz soloist, I had to grow comfortable with playing improvisationally. My experience has empowered me to think unconventionally in solving novel problems. In my senior year, I hoped to leave a legacy and give back to the band community for all that it had given me. I was selected to be the president of my high school’s music honor society. As president, I organized concerts, featuring performers from within the honor society, in local venues such as pre-schools and senior centers to foster community and spread the joy of music.
","In my junior summer, I attended the New Jersey Governor’s School for Engineering and Technology, where I worked on my first research project with a group of 5 students. Through the four week summer program, we researched the efficacy of several machine learning classifiers, including Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest, in detecting credit card fraud. Ultimately, we submitted our research paper to the MIT Undergraduate Research Technology Conference and were rewarded the opportunity to present our findings. I found the experience incredibly rewarding, and I came into college excited to further my research experiences. I hope to participate in Discovery Research because I am motivated to use my time in college to extend my computer science knowledge into various domains. Some of my recent ventures include studying Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course, playing around with Photoshop, as well as working through Xcode tutorials. I view college as the best opportunity to acquire new skills that will drive me towards reaching my goals in life. Through the Discovery Research Program I hope to learn how to use the tools that actual data scientists use in their work, but also apply my current data science/computer science skills into creating a socially impactful project. I dream of using computer science for social good in my future career, and I view the Discovery Research Program as an excellent first step into that direction. 
","Through all four years of high school, I participated in marching band, arguably one of the most disciplined and team-centered activities. I have learned about the importance of leadership in any team effort to oversee the large-picture flow of the project, make final decisions, act as a role model for the rest of the team, as well as inspire the team to work through challenges in order. However, I have also learned the importance of mutual trust between a leader and other team members. The most important principle of marching band is that every musician must act with strict professionalism, holding themselves personally accountable for their role in the band. A team only functions successfully if every member does their job, and does their job well. If mistakes are made, the team member must act responsibly and resolve any consequences. 
	I applied these lessons I learned from marching band to my own research project when I assumed a leadership role in my project team. I made many final decisions in regards to the direction of our research, from deciding what topic to research to finalizing which strategy to employ in handling a high skew dataset. I assigned tasks based on the strengths and weaknesses of each team member, and during stressful moments in our project I helped mediate conflict, or suggested snack breaks. Our team had great synergy and we proudly completed an insightful research project. I consider my teammates lifelong friends. 
",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"In my sophomore year of high school, my AP Computer Science teacher participated in a program started up at Stanford, called CS for Social Good. During each class, he lectured on topics that related to how computer science can be used to enact social change, such as human-centered design, and the importance of empathy. One part of the program delved into sentiment analysis and its implications for detecting cyberbullying through tweets. This was my first time ever hearing about sentiment analysis, and it fascinated me that a machine could parse language and comprehend human emotion. As a college student, I hope to take advantage of my time and resources to explore Sentiment Analysis in greater depth because of its potential for immense social impact. I believe that this particular project explores the social dynamics of the formation of community, which is extremely crucial in the modern age of the internet, where anonymity enables degradation and bullying. I resonate with the vision of this project, as it’s findings can meaningfully extend to discovering the factors which bring people together in an inclusive online environment. I hope to work on this research project because I care greatly about its far-reaching social implications. 

",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"This semester, I took my first linguistics course LING5: Language and Linguistics. I initially registered for the course without much thought, but the class absolutely blew me away. I was fascinated by the complexity of language, which many people simply take for granted each day. My most favorite topic in the class was language universals, because I found it extremely interesting that despite the diversity of all the existing languages in the world, languages still naturally abide by certain rules due to various explanations, such as the ease of acquisition of certain syntactic structures, or distinctness of the acoustic properties of vowels. Besides exposing me to the wonders of linguistics, the class also grew my interest in how computers can understand spoken language, given the general regularity of structure of language. Thus, I began this semester to read about Natural Language Processing to gain a general understanding of its functionality before diving into my own exploration of the skill. I hope to take advantage of the Discovery Program to gain a greater understanding of the intersection of computer science and linguistics, which is why I would love to be placed onto this particular project team. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I come from a large public high school with approximately 2800 students. My high school, unfortunately, had a toxic environment, which inevitably led to a rampant epidemic of mental health issues. These experiences have motivated my desire to explore the systemic flaws of American education, raise conversations about mental health, and push for policy changes. I am interested in this particular research project because it explores the socioeconomic inequalities that disadvantage certain students, hindering themselves from reaching their full academic potential. By exploring the correlations between ethnicity, income, and academic achievement, this research project could help Berkeley public schools understand how to effectively allocate their limited resources in helping students who are disadvantaged strive to greater heights. Furthermore, I find this project incredibly interesting because it may shed some light on the efficacy of affirmative action. I am personally interested in understanding which factor, income or ethnicity, is more indicative of greater academic achievement because it may inform colleges on which factor to prioritize in their affirmative action policy. Ultimately, I see this research project as a first step down a career path working to better the education system in America.

It has pushed me out of my comfort zone often, but has definitely made me stronger and more persistent. Outside of school, one of my hobbies is practicing videography. I really enjoy capturing special memories and moments in my life to look back on later as a very sentimental person! ","Through Discovery Research, I wish to gain more insight into practical applications of data science. The experience the program offers is unique from schoolwork, and I strongly believe that I can gain a better understanding of the field and its roles outside of the typical academic environment. I also look forward to being challenged by the research process and growing from it. I not only want to pick up new technical skills, but also learn more about the research flow and how a data science team approaches problem solving. ","I think the most crucial component of teamwork is communication. For a team to be efficient and function at its best, it requires frequent, clear, and considerate communication between members. A team can better achieve its goals when everyone is on the same page in order to provide proper support or fix areas of weakness. I also strongly believe that every team member has something to contribute and we should strive to play to everyone's strengths or interests to get the best results. ",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"I'm interested in this project because I believe that it is meaningful work. This package will be applied to later machine learning research, and I find that I am more motivated and will take more initiative when working on something useful that others can later utilize. I also am looking to gain data science experience in a lab setting where I can learn more about practical applications, and this project is a perfect fit for that. Through the Discovery Program, I am looking to be challenged in order to learn and grow as much as I can. I have some machine learning experience, but I hope to build on that knowledge through this project and be challenged as I explore the less familiar field of Chemistry. ",NASA data viz,"I find the project premise to be extremely fascinating as I've never approached analyzing a person's eyes in a data and analytical sense. I would love to work on this research because not only is the research intriguing, but I truly believe it will be valuable in the future as we learn what strongly affects pilots to better train them for more safety. This project has the goal of a developed software, and I find that I am most motivated when working towards building a complete product because of the satisfaction at the end.

Throughout my education, I have been involved in various extracurricular roles (such as leading a club on my own, joining the student government at both schools, and being involved in teaching), I have developed a system of principles in effectively managing, leading and communicating with groups and individuals, which is very important in collaborative teamwork as programming projects. My programming skills have been greatly strengthened through my concentration in coursework such as CS61A and CS61B, teaching CS61A at Computer Science Mentors, and also experimenting my own programming projects during my internship at an investment bank.

Given my background in applied mathematics and technical skills and industry knowledge that I have accumulated through internships and campus organizations, my academic interest now rests on exploring Numerical SDEs, PDEs, and ODEs, and I seek to discover their application and interfaces with the concept of Big Data. Outside of Data Science, I constantly challenge myself by working on additional coursework through Coursera, in areas such as Machine Learning and Stochastic Processes. I have also joined my mathematics professor's research group to further expand my passion in Quantum Computing Algorithms to solve Quantum Linear Systems.","After reviewing this program, I felt excited and cannot wait to participate in the Discovery Research, and I sincerely wish to make myself more prepared for future academic through valuable deliverables of this research project. 

Firstly, The Data Science Discovery Program connects undergraduates with hands-on, team-based opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge data research projects with graduate and post-doctoral students. Since my academic goal now is to apply for masters programs for future study in the field of data analytics. The experience to work with graduate and post-doctoral students is meaningful for me to get more prepare for my further academic. I will learn much from them to know how a graduate or post-doctoral conduct their research project. 

Secondly, through taking CS and DS classes and doing well in them, I have had several A and A+ in these courses. It is a good chance for me to solidify what I have learnt and see how they can be applied in real research project. In addition, I will learn more professional skill and knowledge when I get deep into a research project. 

Thirdly, some research projects do attracts me lot. And I can also see how the data science tools be applied to fields in real life. In addition, my previous research or course experience are very related to the requirements of the programs.

Lastly, Data Science is one of my preferred concentrations for graduate study. Since I have had some research experience in machine learning and data driven methods, and courses of Data 100 will provide me pf fundamental knowledge of data science, it is my wish and desire to strengthen my specialty in data and put data theories into real use. ","Communication is key to teamwork, which is required for being productive in Data Science. Since most companies have teams of data scientists working together on a specific project due to the many possible ways to explore data and apply models, I believe communicating one’s findings in a clear and concise way is the most essential skills, and is something that I actively work on and am conscious about.

In the Discovery program, I will work closely with instructors and my peers, to discuss and tackle the problems and challenges our group is faced with. During this process, I will be modest and always open to others' opinions and suggestions. I believe it is most vital for a group to be productive and have healthy relationships among group members. Also, I will actively contribute my suggestions and ideas to the group. When it comes to doing work and team assignments, I will not only do my part in the highest productive way, but also collaborate with my peers, and to help other people who need a hand. When challenges come, I will help identify the problems, produce feasible solutions, and do my best to contribute.

Also, I try to do my best in boosting the team's morale. I have been an active member of student governments and had various occasions giving speeches and providing mentorship sessions. During that period, I found that all students joined clubs of various interests with great zeal in the beginning, however, due to miscellaneous factors, some leaders find it difficult to keep their organizations active and even think of giving up, and members of clubs also lose incentives to keep active in clubs. Taking charge of managing the organizations, the last thing I want to see is abandoning. Therefore, I kept in close touch with all the founders and pay attention to helping and encouraging them to solve problems they encounter. For example, when they lack fund to hold activities, I taught them to write proposal and contact businesses around our school to search potential sponsorship. With my encouragement and assistance, most of founders overcome their troubles and abandoning rate of organizations remains at a low level. From this experience I learned that it's important for a team to keep its morale and interest. Hence, I will try my best to connect with my team peers, and work closely with them, to continuously contribute boost the morale, passion and interest of the team by contributing, encouraging, and helping.

I am a friendly, reliable, and punctual person. And I am willing to dedicate a large portion of my time to work, and contribute at the discovery program!  I promise that I will be very active in helping with people I am working with in Discovery program. I have a strong desire to join the Discovery program, to become part of something together.",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"With previous experience developing such financial analysis algorithms, participating in research for data driven methods, and also attending courses and workshops in terms of financial modeling, I have had great passion in applied data analytics in finance, and also aim to transform the financial industry by first establishing my foundations in a Masters program in Business Analytics.

When I am motivated, I love learning new things and I tend not to give up so easily. Growing up, my goal was never to be at the top of my class academic-wise in school and whatnot; however I realized that if I wanted to help support my parents, little brother, and myself in the future, I'd have to start trying. Every thing I have done since high school to get to UC Berkeley to get to where I am now, has always been due to my drive to help support my family.

I learned to be even more independent than I ever was since coming here and I'm optimistic for whatever life holds for me.",I'd never gotten the opportunity to be part of a data science program that wasn't some required course I had to take here. Most of my data science knowledge and experiences compounded over the past few years from college were from sitting in a classroom and attending lectures. I hope to be able to gain even more perspective on the applications of data science in the real world and to get a better sense of what the community is like. I hope to meet new people and to be able to expand my horizons more(an area I feel has been lacking given that I am already a third year).,"My approach to teamwork is to simply do my part and contribute something that is at least worthwhile to the bigger picture. As I have found in a lot of my courses here on Berkeley, two heads are better than one. I enjoy working with other people on data science related projects hence why I was compelled to be a DS 100 lab assistant. Also it is good to get opinions from other people and to be able to bounce ideas off of them. Most of the time, they have an idea, that you would have never come up with on your own or vise-versa.  Also it feels good to have someone to talk to while you're grinding through projects ;).
 I was surprised when a lot of my friends ended up coming to me for help in understanding core concepts or debugging their code in my data science courses. It lowkey shocked me since I rarely had the privilege of being able to teach people the material on my own and feel like an expert in my own right (or at lest feel like I actually know what I am doing in a class). It was enriching to not only work with people but to be able to help them. I hope to be able to continue that sentiment this semester!

I want to be able to help spread more awareness about health issues by collecting data from the real world and learning more about what our common practices that humans partake in that negatively affect their health, what practices they should partake in to better their health etc. I want to extrapolate data to learn what are the top factors behind certain diseases like cancer, obesity, etc.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"I am interested in this project because I enjoy applying data science to new and fresh practices. I have worked on building a spam classifier for one of my data science courses and I have read about algorithms that help detect hate speech or ""bad sentiments"" but never have I actually had the opportunity to work on one. I am quite interested in seeing what I can do and what I can bring to the table in helping to develop this algorithm.

I became interested in computer science after taking a CS class my junior year of high school. I loved that programming requires me to use both technical and creative skills. I've followed my interests in tech by interning at a startup, joining Virtual Reality at Berkeley, and doing research this summer at the University of Chicago. At UChicago, I worked on a project using deep learning to classify clouds. I enjoyed this project because I got to work closely with students and professors in the geophysics department. I learned how machine learning is being used to advance climate change research. This experience sparked my interest in the intersection between computer science and climate change, and more generally computer science + social good. I am also interested in design; I'm working towards the Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation. In my free time I love making stickers and apparel, I sell them online and help groups on campus make their own merchandise. ",I would love to improve my technical skills and receive guidance from older students and faculty. I've been looking to get into research at Berkeley and think this program would be a great opportunity to work on a project that fits my academic and personal interests. ,"I think communication is essential to teamwork. That means frequent meetings and an environment that encourages questions. I think tasks should be divided into smaller groups/individuals, giving members with less experience the chance to work alongside with someone who can help them learn and answer questions.",NASA data viz,"I’m interested in this project because it would enable me to build off my existing research and programming skills. Last summer, I worked as a research intern at the University of Chicago on a project centered around how climate change affects clouds. I contributed to the project by creating an application to label cloud images and satellite data for use in a neural network. I also researched and tested unsupervised clustering algorithms, edited a research paper, and presented our team’s progress to groups of 50+ people throughout the summer. Moreover, I created data visualizations for use in an academic paper and poster presentations at the American Geophysical Union’s Fall 2019 Meeting in San Francisco and The 9th International Workshop on Climate Informatics in Paris. This experience makes me confident that I could be useful to the team when working with large datasets/creating software in python. Moreover, I’m a fast learner and enthusiastic about the project. I would love to learn more about software development in the context of this project and how to work with eye-tracking data. In general, I am super interested in air travel and pilot performance. I come from a family of pilots and grew up playing with flight simulations. Although I’ve finally ditched my childhood dream of becoming a pilot by majoring in computer science, this project would be a nice way to bundle my interests altogether. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"I've been interested in natural language processing since I took a mini-course on computational linguistics during a summer program in high school. Since then I've dabbled in the topic, but I've been waiting for an opportunity at Berkeley to learn and apply it in a project setting. I think this project would be a great way to use my data analysis skills and dive into NLP.

I plan to strengthen my technical skills while being able to meet and collaborate with driven and creative students from diverse academic backgrounds and interests. ","I believe the key to teamwork is communication and flexibility. I think every member of the team should be given a chance to contribute and to learn something from the project of the team. That involves team members asking each other questions, communicating their time commitments or confusion, and making sure that everyone is on the same page. Furthermore, I believe each teammate should be confident in pushing for their ideas but also understanding and open-minded about their peers' difficulties or disagreements. ",Assessing Research Usability for Development Practitioners in Southern Africa,"I agree with the project's problem statement that little attention is paid to how research is perceived and used. I think this issue applies not only to natural resource management but also to many other fields, therefore the findings of this project can be very relevant.

As a first-year student without much experience in data science last semester, I have faced a lot of challenges. However, both the community and my teammates have supported and encouraged me along my way, and I am proud of having the opportunity to become of part of this loving community. As a team, we successfully came up with conclusions in bay area housing prices. In a future project, I hope I can be more creative in coming up with ideas and plans to help my team.",Data Visualization for User Experience,"I believe that the ultimate purpose of data science is to tell the story behind data so everyone can understand. Thus, data visualization is one of the most important skills that we must gain in order to make everyone read and understand easily. I'm learning to use several data visualization tools such as Tableau in my free time, but I'm always seeking opportunity to learn about how to apply these skills to real world settings. 
This project provides a great opportunity to gain hands-on, team-based experience on translating abstraction of qualiative sources to graphs that everyone can read and understand easily through data visualization techniques. By working and learning from other students, I hope to apply these skills to my future research and study. ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"As I double major in data science and economics, I'm always seeking the opportunities to connect my interests together. I believe that this project would give me a great opportunity to learn about data analysis, particularly under the setting of financial analysis. I would also be taking Financial Economics class to better understand finance. Through this project, I hope to gain hands-on experience that would introduce me to data prediction, streaming data analysis, financial analysis in real-world applications. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"I believe that one of the most important principle of learning and using data is to serve the society. I'm super interested in this project because it directly provide benefits for people in need. Homelessness is a huge problem in the Bay Area and we have seen a growing number of youth among the homeless. Although I might not have the physical or financial ability to provide a safe space to live, I think I can still try my best to help them in an alternative way. This project provides me with the best opportunity to directly help those youth experiencing violence and chaos to find a safer space to live. Besides this social service opportunity, this project will also challenge me through complex data analysis process and introduce to advanced data science study.

Entering undergrad, I pursued mathematics because I appreciated the idea of a proof: that almost anything can be expressed in terms of simple axioms. Data science applies this axiomatic thinking to the real world, maintaining the logical rigor of mathematics without sacrificing in practicality. Through my academic and internship experiences, I found a passion for applied research, with broad interests in sparse data, time series analysis, and NLP.

I am also interested in stochastic processes and Ito calculus, having conducted some research with a PhD mentor through the Math department's Directed Reading Program. Outside of data science, I am interested in finance and entrepreneurship, but there are certainly places in these fields where data science applies well.

I stand by the systematic approach in any context, which is why I am drawn to data science and its applications in today's data-driven world. Although my research experience focuses on underutilized methods, I am passionate about data science at large. There are an infinite amount of ways to employ data collection, visualization, and modeling to improve the lives of others. To be a part of even one such project would be an incredible opportunity.","I am excited about Discovery Research because it provides a space to tinker and innovate while driving real impact in the world. The Discovery Projects for Spring 2020 all maintain clear goals for improving our knowledge of significant topics in society, healthcare, the environment, entrepreneurship, and more. Through participation, I hope to gain broad yet deep exposure to data science techniques employed in contexts I would not typically encounter. With the nature of each project varying widely, the opportunity to apply data science to an extensive range of use cases is a unique and invaluable one. Above all, I hope to drive a socially impactful cause that I am passionate about while learning along the way.","The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I firmly believe in the power of collaboration, and have demonstrated this throughout my academic, leadership, and industry experiences. In class, I look forward to group projects because I get to meet and work with new people that bring fresh perspectives toward the material. A diverse collection of novel approaches is integral to a well-rounded and robust project.

Inclusivity is my main point of emphasis as a leader. In my experience leading clubs, whether career or culture focused, I always ensure that building a strong sense of community is involved in all activities. I believe that with the support of others that share your ambitions and passions, taking on a difficult task becomes much easier.",NASA data viz,"Coincidentally, my dad worked on the flight simulation HUDs for NASA Ames.

Growing up in a multigenerational household (parents, grandparents, sister) as a first generation American, I was immersed in a dual culture life. At seven, I began guiding my grandparents in their unfamiliar world. As I translated for them and facilitated their daily needs, I witnessed firsthand the physical and social challenges they faced, specifically in health care. This included BART accessibility for the disabled, difficulty communicating in hospital settings, and limited access to medicine and education resources. As I progressed through high school, and interned for the local government, these health issues laid the groundwork for my interest in pursuing a career in health and data analysis. 

Now as an undergraduate studying Public Health at Cal, I hope to strengthen my knowledge in the field and establish technical skills in data science to provide solutions to these societal issues in the near future. As an aspiring leader, advocator, and analyst in Public Health, I foresee the immense value of using data science (hypothesis testing, regression modeling, real-world data) to practically design solutions to improve the health of the communities around me.","Through Discovery Research, I hope to continue to build a strong data science foundation and technical skillset to support my broad public health curriculum. Specifically, I hope that in applying data science and computer skills I have learned in a real-world setting, I will gain confidence in approaching similar data-driven problems and solutions in my future career. I see Discovery Research as a pathway to bridge my strong interests in health and data as I work towards a career in biostatistics, technology, and population health to address the needs of Bay Area communities and beyond. This program will allow me to translate the theoretical knowledge learned in the classroom into practical approaches and solutions that impact and serve people throughout the world. 

More importantly, I find this opportunity to collaborate with my peers, experienced mentors, graduates, and organizations extremely valuable as a student. Beyond what I can do to help collaborators address their data challenges, I want to maximize my time by learning from this group of mentors as much as possible through teamwork, asking questions, and collaboration. ","Through interning with local government and my involvement in health committees on campus, I have become experienced in people management, working well with others through opposing viewpoints, and efficiently progressing toward solutions. To me, a great team member is an active listener, unselfish collaborator, and someone who has social awareness. I am comfortable working independently and contributing to teams, and I honestly believe that both are necessary to contribute at maximum efficiency. In my previous work experiences, I was fortunate to do some of both. In the beginning of projects, meetings, or new plannings, I appreciate strategizing approaches and tackling issues with team members. Once our plan of action is established, we work independently on assigned tasks and help each other if needed.

I tend to lead with confidence by being an example to others – by showing others what it looks like to have integrity and dignity through my actions and by holding myself accountable in all that I do. Above all, I am always motivated and willing to cover others’ responsibilities and take on the unseen work that may not receive the highest praise.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"Over the past few decades, homelessness has been an increasingly prevalent public health issue, especially in the Bay Area. While working with Cal UPHC’s community health committee last semester, we focused on issues surrounding homelessness within the Berkeley community. As a small team, we interacted with the homeless population and local organizations to educate the public utilizing infographics, increase homelessness visibility, and create long-term sustainable solutions toward an improved life. As an aspiring public health leader, I would love to tackle one of the Bay Area’s most persistent challenges: protecting our youth from structural violence in their communities.

I am strongly interested in this project because it aligns with my career goal: to utilize collaborative decision-making and data curation in a public health context to improve the communities I serve. After taking Data 8, Berkeley’s Foundations of Data Science course, and CS 88, a course on computational structures of data science, I am excited and eager to apply the skills I’ve learned in data visualization, machine learning, and data analysis to the design implementation, organization, and data conversion aspects of the SF-YEAH project. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"Education inequality and educational disadvantages are underrated public health issues. I was raised in public education in the Bay Area and have experienced firsthand the various social and environmental factors that can contribute to the achievement gaps in schools. Such challenges include family income differences, access to exclusive resources, and perhaps even racial differences. As an aspiring public health leader, I would love to better understand the elements and factors influencing achievement gaps in Berkeley Public Schools. Through effective data extrapolation, analysis, and visualization of the district data, I hope to be able to work with others to practically explain the issues through data and work with the district towards solutions to improve the achievement gaps.

I am interested in this project because it aligns with my career goal: to utilize collaboration and data analysis in a public health context to improve the communities I serve. After taking Data 8, Berkeley’s Foundations of Data Science course, and CS 88, a course on computational structures of data science, I am eager to apply the data visualization, machine learning, and hypothesis testing skills to the underlying aspects of this Berkeley Public School achievement gap project that require this level of rigorous analysis.",Data Enabled Donations,"I am interested in this project because it is a data collaborative project in which I would have the opportunity to work alongside peers and mentors in the decision-making process. I would also love to learn more about data and disaster recovery and how donations impact disaster response. As an aspiring leader in public health, I aim to provide solutions to improve the communities in need and the people around me. In years past and in years to come, disasters are happening with extreme frequency, so using data analysis, I want to understand how to best help these communities develop solutions financially. 

In GPP 115, a course discussing the challenges and hopes in the new millennium, I learned about philanthrocapitalism as a potential solution to alleviating poverty. We analyzed case studies of the Bill Gates Foundation, disaster capitalism, and the restructuring of New Orleans’ economy following Hurricane Katrina. As the class progressed, I became surprised by the lack of efficient financial management among nonprofits and equally fascinated by people’s willingness to make massive donations to organizations in our digital age. So, how can organizations ensure efficient, optimal, and ethical use of their finances?

The reason for these hospitalizations was often not allergies, weather, or diet, as it is for most other people who suffer from this condition. Instead, it was because of my incessant passion to play sports, a passion that had my heart writing checks that my lungs simply couldn't cash. 

Even now my ardor for sports remains relentless, but it has been for a good reason. Sports has given me so much: an outlet from the intense pressures of being pre-med, a home with the Sports Analytics Group at Berkeley (for if it was not for them I wouldn't have discovered this program in the first place) and the dream of pursuing sports medicine and hopefully, one day, being the team doctor for the Golden State Warriors.  ","While I do have experience with coding through my time studying R, I feel that, with the way data science is seemingly changing industries overnight, the field of medicine is the next one to be revolutionized. Although I do have past research experience, most of that is wet-lab based and the extent of my data visualization and manipulation was limited to Excel. By participating in Discovery research, I hope to learn first hand of the ways that data science is being used to tackle medical issues. Furthermore, I hope to learn the technical vocabulary and algorithms needed for more elaborate data science problem-solving. ","I believe that the most basic tenet of good teamwork is that of communication. Especially at this stage in our lives, many individuals have strong personalities that either wound up clashing or overbearing on others. As a teammate, I ensure that everyone's voice is heard and understood by all. 

After communication, the next important thing we must keep in mind is to make sure that people hold each other liable. While listening to everyone's ideas is a necessity, it also important to establish order and make sure that we don't get lost in the words and actually take action.

Recently, I was involved in a transportation planning project with the City of Napa. It was eye-opening for me to discover how data science plays a huge role in planning processes. In the project, I analyzed census and population data to form proposals for transportation policies.

I also have a love for teaching and tutoring. I have volunteered for tutoring centers in the past to tutor students in mathematics and related subjects. I am actively lab assisting for Data 8 as well. It is a wonderful experience to be able to help students grow and guide them through the course material.","Having never been involved in formal research before, I wish to gain insight into the research process. I am interested in the steps needed to explore a proposal, collect the appropriate data, and draw conclusions. I am also interested in the ways that data science can be used to identify trends while maneuvering around obstacles-- incomplete datasets, confounding variables, etc. 

I am also looking to expand on the ways that data can be applied in fields that relate to urban planning. Cities are both dictated and reliant on a huge array of factors such as electricity, water, demography, and economy. All of these fields produce and work with data on a daily basis. I am interested in using data science to understand how these factors can impact cities and how data can be used to better urban spaces.","I believe that communication is essential in teamwork. Team members should cooperate and work together in order to accomplish tasks and move towards common goals. Whenever there are unforeseen circumstances or issues that may hinder progress, it is necessary to communicate this with others on the team so everyone is aware and prepared. Team members should also communicate to bounce ideas off of each other, brainstorm, and refine each other's work. This way, everyone receives feedback to improve and produce their best work each and every day. Finally, great communication is essential in establishing firm expectations and clear goals for the entire team to follow. This ensures success for team members when they embark on individual assignments.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"The Bay Area’s housing crisis continues to worsen through factors such as gentrification and the rising cost of living, causing not just adults, but more children to be homeless. I am particularly passionate about this issue — part of my goal as an urban planner is to make cities more equitable and accessible to all. While I have already explored the policy and planning aspect of aiding homeless youth, I am excited to explore how spatial data analysis can be used to provide solutions to this issue. Additionally, I would like to explore the processes behind generating and “cleaning” multiple mediums of data into one comprehensive set. Data is never collected perfectly and I want to explore the strategies to combat this and create more readable datasets. While I do not have formal research experience, I am confident this opportunity will allow me to grow as a data scientist and a city planner. I am enthusiastic, willing to invest my time to learn any necessary skills, and am ready to apply my existing knowledge to the assigned task.",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"Food system injustice is a huge concern in urban areas today and is a topic I am highly passionate about. I was surprised when I first found out that metropolitan areas often contain food deserts where access to healthy groceries is difficult for citizens. It seems almost counterintuitive that the centers of civilization should contain such areas of food deprivation. Unfortunately, this is prevalent across North America, with the most severe cases often affecting low-income or minority communities. Injustice can even be observed in Berkeley’s Southside which lacks nearby fresh grocery stores, following the closure of Sam’s Market in 2019. I am interested to find out how secondary education systems in the U.S. can perpetuate and possibly influence these trends within our world. I believe it is important and necessary to explore how institutions can inadvertently produce negative externalities and affect societal norms. While I do not have formal research experience, I am willing to discover, grow, and readily learn new skills while applying my existing knowledge. This opportunity will allow me to grow both as a data scientist and as a city planner.",Data visualization and analytics for off-grid solar in Africa,"I am passionate about this project because of both the topic and scope of the research.

I grew up in a safe and quiet neighborhood and attended Lynbrook High School, where the large majority of students was Asian-American and the largest problem widely talked about was getting an A. Berkeley has been a welcome, exhilarating change for me. I have learned about ideas that were never discussed before and met people who grew up from completely different backgrounds. 

Since high school, I had always considered going into the field of medicine and my experiences (academic and extracurricular) at Berkeley have solidified that goal. What I did not expect was to also love data science; but, after taking Data 8 and proudly looking at my data visualizations, I was hooked. I additionally love learning new languages and recently completed my minor in Spanish. I hope to find a research project where I can merge some of my passions: data science, love for languages, and medicine.

Outside of academics, I have led a pre-medical fraternity, worked as a technician and scribe at private practice, been a long-time participant in a Language Exchange Program, and been a camp counselor for Camp Kesem.","I would love the opportunity to apply the skills that I have learned in my data science classes so far to explore more about a topic that I am interested in and contribute to a research project that will hopefully better other's lives and lead to more understanding in a subject that is still relatively new and foreign. As I have never participated in data science specific research, I would appreciate the opportunity to understand more about what data science research looks like and how it compares to wet lab or clinical research. As I look ahead at my post-grad years, I believe the experience with the Discovery Program would greatly help me determine what type of research I am most passionate about. 

I would be grateful for any opportunity to use my skillset to further a research project. I hope to also be able to work with coworkers and/or a mentor --  building meaningful connections with a community of researchers/academics. I also wish to gain more insight on the research project and topic to which I am assigned and deepen my understanding in a field that I am interested in. ","I have noticed that in a lot of group project settings, I naturally slide into the role of a mediator. My approach to teamwork involves active listening, understanding of individual and team goals, as well as empathy-based conflict mediation and compromise. 

I believe the first step to working well in a team is understanding where everyone is at through active listening. Once there is a better understanding of what everyone wants to get out of a project and their capacity (time/energy) that they can give to the project, it becomes easier to make team agreements and goals so the rest of the process runs smoothly. I also believe teams function more efficiently when there is some awareness of individual members' strengths, weaknesses, and goals. Delegating tasks based on strengths and passions will help improve general passion for a project and likely, quality of work.

I also believe being able to mediate conflicts in a productive manner is essential to handling road blocks and challenges that arise. I use empathy to help mediate tense conflicts by helping people with different viewpoints understand one another better and empower the different parties (myself, included) to work together to come to a compromise.  ",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"Since taking a course on Environmental Justice (ESPM 163AC), I have been interested in the large effect of environmental pollutants on human health. I was shocked to see how much the expected lifespans of citizens in nearby communities differed due to differences in race, socioeconomic statuses, proximity to factories, etc. I am privileged in that I come from a background where I barely had to give my environment any thought. I had access to nearby hospitals, no polluting factories nearby, stable housing, and access to a relatively well-funded public education system. I had never before been aware of the incredibly large impact environment has on human health and would love the opportunity to learn more about this and consolidate a map and database that could help others visualize these environmental factors and learn more about how they impact health nationwide. 

I plan to enter the field of medicine and I believe that a knowledge of public health issues and social determinants of health is essential to being well-rounded, empathetic, and effective physician. Having a clearer understanding of a patient's social situation can lead to more effective treatment suggestions and understanding of their pathology.

I believe that there is a wealth of information in the dataset described and I think that finding trends and drawing connections between all of the quantitative data and patient outcomes has exciting implications for future treatments of cardiovascular disease. 

I additionally would love any opportunity to learn more about cardiovascular disease and this project seems like a wonderful chance to learn more in a way that is not possible in a classroom setting. I am thrilled by the opportunity to discover new information about a disease that impacts so many worldwide instead of merely reading about existing knowledge from textbooks. As I plan to apply to medical school, I am also interested in this project because it would be my first look into how I could realistically merge my passion for data science and medicine in the future.",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"As a data science major planning to go into the field of medicine, I am excited by the opportunity to use my data science skillset to learn more about bladder cancer. I would love to contribute to a research project where the findings could lead to a better understanding of the pathology, more effective treatment plans for patients, and hopefully a reduction in cancer mortality. I believe that there is a wealth of information in the dataset described and that finding trends and drawing connections between all of the data and the patient outcomes has exciting implications for future treatments of bladder cancer.

I also would love the chance to learn more about this specific form of cancer in a setting that is very different than the classroom. I am thrilled by the opportunity  to discover new information about a disease that impacts so many Californian patients as opposed to merely reading about existing facts from textbook. I also see that the project involves applying natural language processing to the dataset, which is a technique that I have been itching to learn more about.

As such, I started working in the Schaffer Lab on a project about using stem cells to alleviate symptoms of Huntington's disease in mice, and have had an amazing time in it. I am particularly drawn to genetics and genomics, and with it, their clinical significance. Following my time at Cal, I hope to work in industry as a bioinformatician and will likely apply to graduate school. 

Outside of class, I enjoy learning front-end web development with the hope of going full stack eventually. I have a few websites I am running for student organizations, as well as one I am developing for my research lab. 

In my free time, I play basketball as much as I can. Sometimes I bike around the bay and other times I hike or camp in nature. I thoroughly enjoy being outdoors as a way to balance a life with cs classes.","Like many students, I thrive when I “learn by doing.” Data science classes are fun and immensely useful, hence I do not want to let my skills fade away due to a lack of use. By doing research, not only do I get to retain my skills, I also gain new ones I wouldn’t otherwise in classes. 

Data science in real life is largely a collaborative effort. I hope to work with amazing people who can help me as much as I can help them. Teamwork is mostly understated in classes so I wish to understand what real teamwork is supposed to be.","Teamwork largely varies depending on the goal of the project. For a data science project with a mentor overlooking us, I would start by outlining the tasks we will be doing. Trivial tasks will be divided among us and difficult ones will be tackled together, ideally in person. That way, we can save each others’ time while learning about solving the real challenges, without anyone left behind. 

I believe communication between team members is an essential component of a successful team. Hurdles should be attempted by individual members but there must be a convenient medium to channel help from the other members. Frequent meetings is also necessary to make sure everyone is up to date on the progress, along with adjustments to the division of tasks as necessary.",NASA data viz,"The project involves the integration of various data types that are unconventional. Eye-tracking data is especially interesting in conjunction with the other data sources since it is not commonly used, and therefore there is room for exploration or improvement. Simulator data is similarly unique, and any opportunity to work with it is truly special.

As a casual fan of airplanes and flight simulators, this project caught my attention since I have never encountered anything like it during my time at Cal. That said, despite not having experience with flight and eye tracking data, I believe my data science skills will carry me through any specialized training I go through.

Looking at the scope of the project, it seems that the project is already well underway. I am excited to be part of a large project and work with many interesting individuals towards a challenging common purpose. I believe that with guidance and working with the right people, I can strongly contribute to this project.",Anomaly detection in Solar Microgrids,"Based on the project description, I see that there is a clearly defined scope of expectations, which I greatly appreciate. Through this project, I believe I can make an impact to your company's efficiency and save money that would otherwise be lost. By extension, more under-served communities can benefit instead of spending resources to deal with malfunctions and theft. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"One of my reasons for pursuing life sciences as a major is due to its impact on people. While research and clinical experiments contribute to the progression of medicine, there is also the data-driven aspect that is less frequently explored. I am specifically looking for data science projects with a focus in the life sciences, including public health.  

I believe my data science skills can carry me through my journey to learn natural language processing, and my experience in biological research will only benefit the project. I am familiar with a fair amount of medical/research vernacular, but beyond that, I am personally drawn to public health issues.

It is important that we maintain structure and support throughout practices and events to ensure we are able to be prepared and punctual. Through my 4 years as a member of this team, I have developed my own approach to teamwork.
I see myself as a team member unless leadership is needed. I think it is important that everyone is collaborative and responsible for their duties, and it is not necessary to have 1 person in control unless there is concern tasks are not being met. I believe as a leader of a team you must be careful to be considerate of others and each member's role. An overbearing leader can make a team feel uneasy and can make members feel unimportant.

For a little background, I am originally from Denver, CO - I grew up with a special interest in mathematics and computer science and cultivated my interest in those areas through technology internships and math competitions. I also thoroughly enjoy reading (avid Harry Potter fan), writing, cinema, and especially music - I have played Indian classical music on the violin for the last 12 years, and have risen to a concert level artist. I discovered data science as a subject after entering Berkeley and was immediately fascinated by its interdisciplinary roots in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and machine learning. Through personal projects, internships, and URAP, I have gained a strong background in all stages of the data science life cycle, including aggregating data (with pandas or selenium webscraping), data analysis (seaborn, matplotlib, pandas), and predictive modeling using scikit learn and tensorflow","I wish to gain experience with working on a long-term data science project in a team setting. In the past, I have done personal data science projects or worked mostly by myself in an R&D-type setting during my internship, but I have not had the opportunity to work in a team with other students and mentors. Data science is a collaborative activity, and I really want to learn from other people, contribute my own knowledge, and hopefully accomplish our long-term goal of doing unique analytics work. I would also like to hone my data science skills, particularly pertaining to machine learning algorithms. I have experience with using ensemble methods like Random Forest and decision trees, as well as neural network architectures like traditional NN and recurrent neural network for pattern recognition in text. I would like to either further my practical knowledge of these algorithms or expand my knowledge to new algorithms for predictive modeling. Overall, I just really love using data science/machine learning to solve or gain insight into all different types of problems, and I am very excited for the opportunity to feed this desire with Discovery Research.","For me, teamwork is all about sharing ideas and making sure that everyone's contributions are heard and incorporated. If I am in charge of a team, I like to delegate roles based on areas of expertise while also factoring in what interests people. I also like to set clear and defined roles for each person on the team so that everyone understands what they are doing and how it contributes to the overall vision/goal of the project. I value teamwork because a group of individuals working in unison is infinitely more valuable than one person trying to accomplish everything on their own - each person brings unique perspectives, skills, and abilities. A well-functioning and driven team can be highly productive because if one team member is stuck with implementing a feature or doing a task, it is more than likely that another person will bring a fresh set of ideas and perspectives to conquer the problem.",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"This past summer I worked on an R&D project for my internship, where I developed a model that takes in a birth certificate from any state and gives predictions for tokens that are likely to correspond to the child's name, date of birth, or parents' information. The project was attempting to automate data entry of child information for the company's clients. My team used a machine learning oriented approach where we did feature engineering using computer vision to tokenize each birth certificate, then collect distance, size, and proximity information for each token to make a prediction on the category it belongs to. We realized that this was not viable because birth certificates vary drastically in their formatting based on the state, so we opted for an RNN/Natural language processing approach that reads the words in from left to right on a birth certificate and makes sequential predictions. The pathologists cancer alert project seems to be a natural progression from the internship project I discussed above, and I am highly interested in learning more about the applications of NLP in this space. I also think I have gained the necessary skills and knowledge of the domain to immediately start contributing in this project, and I am excited about the opportunity to work collaboratively with the team!",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"This project interests me because I have past experience in analyzing tweets using Twitter's API to collect general public sentiment about a particular stock (for stock price movement analysis). Although this is not the same project, that experience opened my eyes to the vast potential for using social media sources such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. to get a sense of overall public sentiment about any subject. As it pertains to inclusive speech, I think it is just as important to establish guidelines for inclusivity as it is for hate speech, because it is just as valuable for a user to know what they are doing right as it is for them to know what they are doing wrong. I am also excited to do feature engineering on this problem because the distinctions between hate/inclusive speech are sometimes blurred, so the task is highly complex. The fact that Facebook has human content moderators in addition to their ML algorithms for detecting hateful/inappropriate content tells me that fully automating this process could be very valuable to many tech companies today. The prospect of working on a complex, relevant problem such as this in today's social media driven society is very appealing to me!",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"This past summer I worked on an R&D project for my internship, where I developed a model that takes in a birth certificate from any state and gives predictions for tokens that are likely to correspond to the child's name, date of birth, or parents' information.

To solve this problem, I turned to data science. I built an automated web crawler that extracted information from the websites of several of their competitors and performed analysis on that information to decide what to set our own prices. With these tools, were were able to predict our sales and model different scenarios based on different prices - ultimately we raised profits by 30% in the next quarter!

Coming from a smaller high school without a technology program, pursing a career or major in data science wasn't on my radar. But seeing the potential data has in solving problems (helping a struggling business, among other things), I'm really interested in learning more, and how we can use data to solve some of the world's most challenging problems.","I’m really looking forward to working with a group of diverse and intellectually curious students on a project that makes a tangible difference to the community. Data science is a new and growing field so I’m know that is a great deal of experience and knowledge I can learn by working on a real life project and figuring out all the small details.

Whenever I am free, I would like to spare time on hobbies: hiking on a nearby mountain, cycling in the park, playing badminton with my friends at RSF, or if time permitting, trying some new songs on my violin. 
Besides Data Science, my academic interest also includes Math and Music. Back at community college, I attended the national AMATYC (American Mathematics Association for Two-Year Colleges) Math Contest from 2017 to 2019 and won cash prizes by ranking No.4 and No.1 overall on campus respectively. My interest in Math motivated me to disseminate the knowledge to more people, so I became a Math tutor and had worked under three different departments.

",NASA data viz,"Since my parents work in an international airline company, I developed my interest in aerospace since I was little. In my earliest memory, I remembered the nights my parents took me out for a walk to the nearest airport, holding my hands, and pointing to the giant planes flying across the dawning sky while I, gasped in awe of the flying machine, was totally satisfied but increasingly curious. As I grew older, I became more interested in the aviation industry. One day in high school, my father took me to visit his Flight Simulator. “Flying” a plane for the first time in my life, I realized that piloting is of much more complexity than I expected. The ability to handle emergencies and deal with unexpected situations requires not only years of experience, but also the help of technology. With experience in Python projects that used machine learning to classify movie genres based on various selections of features, I developed necessary Data Science skills to analyze and visualize data in multiple categories. I feel passionate to pick up my childhood dreams, but also to help further enhance the technology that helps pilots make better decisions in challenging situations.",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"Having been attending public schools in my entire life, I am a witness of schools with different levels of achievement and I realized the complexity embedded within it. As a transfer student from East LA College, I witnessed the decline of student enrollment in several community colleges because of the cut in public education funding. Conversely, few schools experienced a considerable growth because of adequate financial support and outstanding transfer profile. Other factors might come into play such as geographic locations, resources, and alumni support. The complexity that leads to achievement gaps interests me and resonates with my own experience. Having done Python projects dealing with real-world data sets such as cardiovascular disease, fertility, and child mortality that are affected with multiple factors, I developed necessary skills that allowed me to identify, analyze, and quantify relationships between different data sets and come up with appropriate scientific conclusions. With such Data Science techniques, I am passionate about applying my knowledge to have some discoveries about what contributes to achievement gaps in Berkeley public schools. ",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"First off, having lived in Beijing in most of my life, I have experienced poor air quality in some of the most terrible cases. I witnessed the days when the PM 2.5 index soaring to about 1000, the playground closed, classes canceled, and nobody willing to step outside. I realized the impact bad air quality has on our daily lives and the importance to take actions to maintain healthy air quality. Secondly, I have done Python projects dealing with real-world data sets that monitor cardiovascular disease and hazard rates in different time periods, which helped me develop essential skills to explore, identify, and analyze data with certain time intervals. With the necessary Data Science skills such as data manipulation and visualization, I hope to apply my knowledge to contribute to creating a healthy environment for the community. Moreover, my bilingual background could possibly help me expand the data sets and add diversities to the information.

","Interning in a ""two pizza"" 8 member team at Amazon, I had the opportunity to work with many people of different backgrounds and positions, from working daily with my mentor, to talking to product managers and designers in our division. When I needed help on my project, I would talk to my mentor first, then talk to other team members for further help. For example, when I was stuck on implementing an UI element, after looking through logfiles and still not figuring out what was causing the issue, I talked to my mentor, who pointed me towards a coworker on the team who worked directly on the UI, who was able to help me figure out what went wrong. With daily standup meetings, I was able to see what each coworker is working on, and form a deep understanding of the entire team's product and process.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"Even though I want to do ML related research, I don't know what specific field interests me the most.

I once thought technology was confined to the tech sector until I volunteered as a receptionist at a local hospital a couple of years ago. I noticed volunteers’ shifts were not arranged efficiently, so I collected data on the number of questions being asked per hour and built a linear model to predict patients’ demand for receptionists. That experience changed how I perceived technology. In order to make a greater impact, I knew I needed to learn more about the society’s needs and strengthen my technical background. Therefore, I have been volunteering for the past few years and gained some insights in different sectors. In order to gain more technical skills, besides taking classes at school, I read manuals outside of the class to learn practical skills like web scraping. I also enjoy taking machine learning classes on Coursera that are not offered at school. By combining my volunteering experience and technical skills, I am excited to solve more challenging real-world problems. ","I took a machine learning class on Coursera with Andrew Ng over the winter break and learned the basic practices of machine learning. The class focused on both the theory and application side of machine learning, but I wish I could have more relevant programming exercises. By participating in Discovery Research, I am hoping to gain more hands-on experience on how to approach a machine learning problem and how to debug my learning algorithm after my initial trial through working with other faculty members and students who are also passionate about the subject. 
I also want to experience how a research project is done. I interned as a backend web developer last summer, and I did enjoy working in the industry. I have never contributed a formal research project before, so by participating in Discovery Research I can experience the entire process of a research project from developing a question at the beginning till working out a solution at the end. If it turns out that I like research more than working in the industry, I might decide to go to graduate school instead of going to the industry after graduating from college. ","My approach to teamwork is to first analyze the problem itself and try to break it down into several smaller sub-problems. Different number of team members are assigned to different sub-problems depending on personal preference and the amount of work it takes to solve that sub-problem. After this initial assignment, each smaller team will start working on their assigned sub-problems. There will be somewhat frequent meetings for all team members to make sure everyone is on the same page.
After developing our initial solution to the problem, it is likely that our solution is not optimal. We could then do a ceiling analysis for different components of our solution to see which part is most worth our time and efforts to work on in order to improve the overall performance. Team members will be reassigned again depending on the relative importance of different components.
Overall, I think it is also helpful to set deadlines. Since we all have lots of commitments, settings deadlines can help us better navigate through the research process. ",UCSF - Text Classification on Clinical Notes,"This seems to be a relatively large and challenging research project at the first glance, but I love challenges! I learned supervised learning and unsupervised learning by taking an online class over the winter break, and two of my favorite projects in that class were housing price prediction and spam classifier. I can see some similarity between those two class projects and this research project, and I am interested in learning more what exactly is the similarity and different between them. I have always been passionate about using technology for social good, so I will be very excited if I can have this opportunity to use machine learning to facilitate clinical research.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"I am interested in this project because I have the opportunity to reinforce a skill I learned a while ago and put into practice some knowledge I just learned recently. 
I learned web scraping in summer 2019 by reading some technical manuals, and I wrote several web crawlers as my side projects. I wrote one for an online shopping site where my crawler scraped 3,600+ products' information per hour including product name, price, review, etc. I wrote another crawler to scrape media URLs and other information from a social media site. I am excited to write scrapers with a more specific goal this time so that the data we collect is clean. 
I recently took an online class about machine learning and learned different learning algorithms. In that class, I learned to build a spam classifier where I classified spams based on occurrence of specific words. For this specific project, we will try to find more complicated trend in product description using natural language processing. I am excited to learn more about natural language processing and apply what I learned to a real-world problem.",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"As a native mandarin speaker, I went to an American high school and took three years of French.

It was sad that I had to give up French this year in order to put more time into computer science. Participating in this project will allow me to use machine learning to learn features not only of French but also of other beautiful languages, and I am excited to simultaneously work on two subjects I am passionate about.

During high school, I took community college courses to build my programming skills and applied them in robotics. For me, programming has always been fun. However, programming is simply a tool, and I want to utilize this tool to best serve others. I am still searching for what that specific area of interest is, but I think I'm close. I first discovered data science when my amazing AP Statistics teacher introduced me to it, and I have spent the last two-and-a-half years during university taking classes to further my understanding. But just like computer science, data science needs to be applied to a project. Thus, during the last two summers, I immersed myself in two wonderful research projects: Adaptive Video Subsampling for Energy-Efficient Object Detection at Arizona State University and Sand Dune Video Prediction at Lawrence Livermore National Labs. Thoroughly enjoying both projects, I was fortunate to have both of them yield in paper publications accepted into conferences. As I continue to explore the different areas of data science and machine learning, I am eager and excited to start on a new research project at UC Berkeley. ","I hope to integrate myself within the data science community so I can best explore this blooming field. Between open-source projects on Github and official packages like fast.ai, the data science community is perpetually active in discussing and solving the most interesting of problems. With an amazing mentor at Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL), I was introduced to this expanding online community of passionate people and it has taught me the true extent of the knowledge that I have yet to learn. UC Berkeley research is at the fore-front and a huge contributor to this community, and I would consider myself immensely lucky and grateful if I could be a part of it. By joining Discovery Research, I know I can join a team of people who are equally as excited as I am, if not moreso, to push the boundaries of research. I believe that there is so much that I can learn from Discovery Research, and I would promise to actively dedicate myself to the project in order to best contribute to it while also bettering my own learning. ","I am a firm believer in open and honest communication within a team. When I first did research under my Arizona State University professors and mentor, I was shy and hesitant to ask questions for fear of appearing incompetent or bothering my professors. Reflecting back, I realize I could have been more efficient by taking the initiative to ask appropriate questions and made sure to implement this during my following research position at LLNL. Especially in research, there is a careful balance between ""working hard"" and ""working smart"". Passion, determination, and time are all essential in pushing a project towards completion. However, there are cases where time can be better spent elsewhere rather than digging ourselves into a rabbit hole. For example, we might want to use an ideal Github code but if all the dependencies are deprecated, we might take a moment to re-evaluate and determine if there is another software we can use. ""Fail fast"" is what my father calls it. While researching, we should not fear ""failure"" but instead expect it and work around it. When making decisions like these, it is import to discuss with our teammates to determine the best course of action going forward. ",Student Success Analytics Platform,"I am interested in satisfying my own personal curiosity. As not only a student but also as a past Teaching Assistant, I am curious about the human mind and how we can best learn. It's frustrating when I am unable to grasp a concept, and it's painful for me to watch my fellow peers fall to stress due to their similar inability to understand. CS370 discusses the different steps of teaching and learning and how to the academic systems fails many students. But at the end of the day, students have many different learning styles that require catering to. Depending on the data, this project holds immense potential in how we can best serve these learning styles so that students can succeed in learning. I would be excited to see what type of questions we can answer with this anonymized data set! ",Computational Analysis of Charter School Identities and Stratification,"This projects appeals to me both in the topic and the type of work. Based on my discussions with peers on charter schools, we have built this image of charter schools being a different experience than the average public school. This holds true especially among my fellow Asian friends. I would be personally curious in validating if this image is true. In addition, I would be really excited in working with web-scraping software. As all data scientist know, we can't do anything without data and the internet is the most abundant source of data out there. I am very comfortable with Python, having used it in my previous two research projects and multiple classes here, and I would be super excited to learn how to use scrapy, selenium, and wget. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I was previously a member of Opportunity Through Data, a student club seeking to reduce recidivism rates by introducing women in prison to data science. The club is now launching a pilot program to local high schools to help the community and test the developed curriculum. When we were reaching out to local high schools, we slowly realized that some high schools were privileged with more external educational programs than other. Seeking to have larger impact, we chose to reach out to high schools with a larger need. Sadly, not all high schools have the same resources and some cannot offer the same quality of educations as others do. To address these issues, we need to first determine which schools are under performing and why that is the case. The state and district data hold the potential of addressing these questions and how we can best serve students in Berkeley Public Schools.

Specifically, I want to work with STEM in the sector of policy and social good as I have worked with the non-profits Girls Inc., Habitat for Humanity, and I have created my own technology camp for girls, TinkerCode. For all of this, I was selected as one of the Oregon delegates to the United States Senate Youth Program. 

At Berkeley, I love taking courses in the social sciences department because I have always been interested in communication and society. Technology is increasingly is applied to these areas, and it can have very rippling and unforeseeable consequences. Additionally, when introducing new technology or innovative engineering methods, it has to be accepted by society. For example, in one major U.S. city, they found that roundabouts caused less traffic buildup than stoplights. However, people became more impatient with roundabouts. So, while roundabouts were found to be more beneficial, they ended up using stop lights because of public perception. Using tech to create a positive social impact and bridge these misleading perceptions is what I ultimately want to do. 
","At my first industrial engineering orientation at UC Berkeley, one of the professors I met asked us “how many of you know what industrial engineering is?” None of us raised our hands; he cracked a smile. “When I was your age, I didn’t know either.” So, these past semesters, I have spent countless hours seeking fellow students, industry professionals, as well as professors, asking them about their professions and lives. After talking to those who have graduated, a disproportionate number of industrial engineers have later found themselves in the field of data science. I want to participate in Discovery Research because I want to learn more about data science through hands-on applications and explore it as a career field.  

As for what technical experience I may already have, I have taken Engin 7, CS61A this spring. I am also currently taking Data 100 and Ind Eng 162 (Linear Programming). Thus, I want to expand my knowledge beyond the classroom and apply the skills I am currently learning on a project I am passionate about. I have also always wanted to see if research is something I should pursue and these projects and ideas seems like the perfect place to start. 
","My freshman fall I had the pleasure of taking UGBA 196 with Stephen Torres. Here, we were put into teams and assigned the task of creating a working prototype every 3 weeks. We also had to conduct user research and interact with our “customer” (Professor and his TA) to determine the difference between what the user wanted and balance that with what we wanted to create. My role on this team was the organizer and supporter. I coordinated amongst my teammates and with our “customer” to ensure a successful, finished product. Our team worked incredibly well together, and every week we exponentially increased our communication skills and efficiency during meetings. I would prompt others for their opinion, and it kept people engaged and comfortable. At the end of each week, we had review sessions where we would diagnose what went wrong. One crucial aspect we all agreed to was honesty. We knew how each other received criticism and how we liked to given constructive feedback; this allowed us to build trust. I want to bring this forward into any future teams I partake in, and I hope to bring this sense of dedication, trust, and energy into the discovery program.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"Cannabis is a new and growing market due to deregulating policies. I want to participate in this project because of its immediate relevance and the opportunity to work with Python to create cleaner data sets and learn more about natural language processing.

To begin with, I want to emphasize my interest in the business/economics. I am in the Haas School of business and in high school, I was the Oregon delegate to the USSYP program for my involvement with policy and government. 

I do not have much experience in NLP, however I am a quick learner. During my internship last summer, we worked with React, MongoDB, and Node, all languages and frameworks I have never touched before. In fact, before this internship, I did not even understand what full stack development was. Learning all the components and learning how they coexist with each other was a huge learning curve, but I am dedicated and hardworking. My greatest strength is creativity and unconventional thinking, and I hope to bring this to how we see the data in order to extract the fullest picture and obtain the most insights. 
",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"During my freshman summer, I had the opportunity to work at CDK Global as a software/data engineering intern. This was where I was introduced to software development and where I finally began to understand what front-end and back-end development were. The learning curve was incredibly large as we worked with MongoDB, React, and Node. By the end, I finally felt as if I understood the importance of each, but now I crave a project where I can continue to my learning but also do so in the programming language I am most comfortable with (Python).

I want to join this project because I am a huge government/policy fan. I was the Oregon delegate to the USSYP program where I had the opportunity to meet a plethora of prominent government individuals such as Neil Gorsuch. I also want to join this project because it works with Python and web development. I do not have a huge technical background, but I ask you to take a chance. I am creative , hardworking, and am willing to take the unconventional route if it to get a full 360 degree perspective to extract the fullest picture of what the data means. 
",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I want to work on this project not only for the technical aspect, but because I am passionate about this topic. 

In high school, I created technology camps for girls in my community alongside NCWIT, the National Center for Women and Information Technology, called TinkerCode. Camps, robotics, and other extracurricular activities were how I became interested in technology, and I wanted to give other girls the same opportunity. I have also worked with Girls Inc. of the PNW through Girls Council to bring the plight that girls face, not just in tech, to a wider audience. I am looking to empower girls in tech and intertwine it with my work in college to hopefully bring about greater education and women empowerment at large technology firms. 

Understanding gaps and shortcomings means we can address it to keep girls in the tech space and happy while they are in it. I want to work on my technical skills, become confident in my technical abilities, and I believe that this project is a place I can learn from in the social sphere as well as build my analytical acumen.

My mom fostered my enthusiasm for CS and its related subjects. 
This passion led me to the field of Data Science. While volunteering at the Immanuel Baptist Shelter, I decided to use my knowledge in programming to help the homeless find jobs. I began by employing JSP to create a job recruitment website in New Haven, CT. I sought employment positions from online postings and, especially, through personal connections: I asked my family and friends to pay close attention to handwritten recruitment postings on the windows of restaurants, stores, cafes, and libraries. Whenever I heard about an open position, I would immediately transcribe the job description and upload it to my website. My website, hence, contains much information that cannot easily be found elsewhere. This experience helped me realize how important Data is for benefiting our lives.
Since then, I have decided to further my study in Data Science to help more people!","Through my various interactions with data, I have realized how essential it is in our daily lives. Right now, I have an app of my own that is supposed to act as a platform for nonprofits to execute their works. However, this needs the help of big data, and I’m currently unable to finish it based on my elementary understanding of Data Science. Therefore, I wish to participate in Discovery Research to further my learning in Data in order to help more people. 
I also wish to communicate my ideas about how to use data to benefit the world with professors, researchers, and fellow students. I believe exchanging thoughts and learning from others can expand my own horizon and encourage me to become more creative!","I value the power of teamwork since I was only eight. I went to a party held by mom’s university. During the party, those professors played a game called “Binary Number:” two teams were given the same decimal number, and they had to calculate its binary number. The team that first got the correct number won.
They started to calculate independently right away. However, I thought of to have all team members line up in a row, each divide their number by 2 and tell the remainder to the next person, moreover, if their own divisor was odd, to stand up, and if it was even, to sit down. This way, people don’t need to calculate all by themselves, and teamwork could help them save more time.
This experience gave me a sense of accomplishment and made me realize how important teamwork is. It is a treasurable opportunity for people to not only show their own power but also learn from their peers.
Therefore, I am always willing to communicate and exchange ideas with my teammates.

I am a Third Culture Kid, meaning my family is originally from India but we migrated before the partition and have settled in Thailand for generations. Because of this, I speak 4 and a half languages: Hindi, English, Thai, Mandarin, and a little bit of Punjabi. I love the premise of an engineer/Computer Scientist/Data Scientist. Solving problems in the best way possible for that particular audience is something we have to ponder on a daily basis and this is what fascinates me. It is not only about getting the answer, it’s about exploring alternate solutions and being daring enough to try out the weirdest or most creative ones, where there really is no limit to how you can solve something or perform a particular task.

New procedures, algorithms, tools are being developed around the world and slowly but surely we are being able to solve more and more problems. So as long as this progress carries forward, so will my motivation. In layman’s terms, as long as there are problems to fix, I will be encouraged to think of solutions to fix them. So one way I can get involved in this process of progress is through the Discovery Research Program.","I feel like I work the best in a team. Especially in this realm of CS and DS, communication is key and often overlooked by many. The best solutions to problems are thought of by putting many minds together. Someone might see something that another person may not. This is why it is essential to ask questions and establish a sense of trust within a team, where no one is judged for saying something outrageous or unorthodox or wrong. I envision teamwork as an environment where people are encouraged to speak their mind and ask questions to encourage mutual growth and where everyone is working towards a common and shared goal.

I have done several community service projects involving clean water in High School, so it will be interesting to this time be on a different side, tackling the issue with my academic passions. I have experience building web apps and mobile apps particularly for iOS so feel like I can provide good help to this project. ",NASA data viz,"The NASA project is an amalgamation of several CS/DS skills: Data Visualization, coding, and analysis. I have rough experience in each of these areas so it is a great way for me to refine what I already know and learn much more about the process. Not only will it provide practical experience outside of the theory learned in classes but it will actually be used in a real world context, it is not merely a simulation or a class project. This project models what we may see in a job outside of university, so it is a great way to get a view into what the future may hold. ",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Never applied previously.

",I previously interned for several months as an AI researcher at IPMD from April to August 2019 and learned a lot about data sets and testing. So that is a big part that may help me through this discovery program.

In my free time I enjoy reading about world news, watching political dramas (Madam Secretary and The Crown),  going to the gym, and taking photos. I became interested in Data Science after seeing the global-scale implications of the Cambridge Analytica scandal as highlighting a need for ethical data scientists. In addition, it helped me understand the truly diverse array of applications for Data Science. I was also largely inspired to pursue Data Science because of my exposure to Computer Science in high school as well as seeing my mother's work as a business analyst. I am also passionate about the intersection between data science and decision making, particularly I am interested in being able to use technology to do this ethically and sustainably as well as to highlight issues in the world that may go uncovered. ","I hope that I can develop both technical and soft skills through the Discovery Research program. I look forward to being able to apply the skills that I have learned in my courses in Berkeley in order to explore an industry or project to create a tangible impact. In addition, I hope to gain exposure in working in a team environment in a research setting context. ","I believe that in teamwork one of the most important attributes that should be emphasized first hand is transparency. Everyone in a team should have a role and have the expectation that their part is necessary for the development of the larger project or task. In order to maintain this I believe that it is important to clearly communicate within a team or between individuals and team leads if an individual feels as through they are overcompensating work or being under-compensated. I also believe that my approach to teamwork is one that is very organized and straightforward. In the past, combining transparency and organization I have used task management tools such as Asana and Trello with various teams in order to visualize progress for tasks as well as keep everyone accountable for what they should be doing.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"I have experience as a Data Management and Research Intern known as the INSAN Foundation, which focuses on working towards bringing awareness food insecurity and homelessness in the LA area. As an intern, I conducted extensive data driven research on these issues and used Tableau as a data visualization tool. I also compiled reports and presentations on statistical and policy research to be used to bring greater awareness of the issue of homelessness. I found that this project was relevant to my prior experience working with similar data and is working on an issue that I am passionate about. Therefore I believe that I have contextual knowledge on curating and finding the data necessary to implement the creation of accessible databases. ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,Many of my prior experiences in dealing with data have been in the contexts of pure science (chemistry) or policies/issues.

I'm Joyce, a sophomore from Chicagoland. Piano is my instrument of choice. I love playing badminton and watching baseball. I got my first formal introduction to data science through a UC Berkeley organization called SAAS (Student Association for Applied Statistics). Since then, I have been immersing myself into the world of data science through conducting my own independent research projects and teaching others. Outside of the classroom, I like to give back to others through teaching and community service. As a data8 lab assistant and AVID tutor, I have been able to learn and grow as an educator. Joining Alpha Phi Omega has enabled me to serve others with passion and a purpose, and has also allowed me to find others who are driven in a similar way.","Through Discovery Research, I hope to utilize my data science skills to directly make an impact on others' lives. The courses that I have taken here at UC Berkeley have enabled me to learn more data science techniques and methods, but have not granted me the opportunity to apply what I know to real-life situations and scenarios. I am constantly wondering about the real world application of the subject and how it can be modeled in our everyday lives. There are so many topics that I want to explore, such as the usefulness of data science in healthcare and genomic sequencing. Diving into research would provide me with some answers and enable new questions to emerge.","I approach teamwork with a 'us' mindset instead of a 'me' mindset. Teams are a collective group of individuals who work towards achieving one common goal. Therefore, it is important that all members of a team are willing to contribute, be flexible, and listen to their peers. When I work in teams, I always do my fair share of work. I am willing to help out in any other way that's needed, whether this be aiding a teammate in debugging lines of code or assisting another teammate in figuring out the best machine learning algorithm to a problem. If any concerns or internal conflicts are brought up between team members, I work with all parties involved to come to a reasonable consensus. I firmly believe that open communication and bonding are essential to a team's success.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I have personally witnessed the destructive measures cardiovascular disease brings to an individual's life and the emotional burdens it loads onto loved ones. Cardiovascular disease has robbed two of my close family friends a father figure during the most pivotal years of their teenage lives. It has stolen my best friend's aunt. These experiences have taught me the great need to push for early heart disease detection and prevention. In high school, I founded an annual Charity Badminton Doubles Tournament that donates all proceeds to the American Heart Association. Going into my academic career at Berkeley, I knew that I wanted to pursue data science to make an impact in the healthcare field. More specifically, I want to use data science techniques and algorithms to improve disease detection. Through this project, I would like to learn more about cardiovascular disease detection and prevention from a data-oriented perspective. I want to take my passion for data science & healthcare and make an impact in both fields. The need for detection and prevention of many diseases is great and cannot be ignored. It is important that we work towards early disease detection to save lives and to make strides in cardiovascular disease discoveries.",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,"This past semester at Berkeley, I had the opportunity to take a data ethics course that introduced me to the topic of precision medicine. Through this course, I have learned about the many benefits precision medicine offers and the growing need for these services by the general public. The All of Us Research Program, headed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in particular greatly interested me. I decided to do some further research and dedicate a course paper to learning more about this program. In high school, when I volunteered at Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, I frequently interacted with a patient diagnosed with Crohn's Disease. I first-handedly witnessed the complications and struggles that Crohn's Disease can cause. Through this project, I would like to learn more about both Crohn's Disease and precision medicine from a data-oriented perspective. I want to take my passion for data science & healthcare and make an impact in both fields. The need for precision medicine in many aspects of medicine is growing. It is important that we work towards improving treatment accuracy to better individuals' lives and to make strides in precision medicine.",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I have been involved in the Berkeley Unified School District's AVID program since my freshman year at Cal. As an AVID tutor, I have interacted with middle school students who have challenged me to become a better educator and student. I am a firm believer in AVID and its mission to close the achievement gap by preparing all students for college. I have first-handedly witnessed the positive impacts AVID has on students. Over the course of a year, one of my students learned to no longer self-doubt her math abilities. What once was a girl who shied away from multiplication problems is now a young woman who can tackle any percentage problem with no hesitation. She used to be afraid of asking others for help, but now she approaches teachers and tutors with the ambition to learn. She has blossomed into one of the best students that I know. I can confidently say that AVID works. Through this project, I hope to transfer my passion for teaching and AVID to making a further impact. I want to gain further insight into factors that contribute to the achievement gap in Berkeley Public Schools.

It all started when I was a kid playing different sports, mostly baseball and hockey. I was never that athletically gifted but what I loved about these sports were all these numbers involved. I would always geek out about numbers, whether it was trying to predict car sales in North America, to finding predictive qualities in player stats. Something always attracted me to being able to see into the future, and coming to Berkeley and getting an introduction to statistics and computer science has allowed me to finally make those dreams come true. I really enjoy working with real world data and working with more and more datasets, I’ve recently realized how important data is for almost any area of study but despite that many fields are behind in digitization and data use. Particularly in education or in ecology, I want to help find new insights in these different fields of study.","For me I really want to gain experience both in learning what it’s like to conduct academic research but also to gain experience working on real life data and creating new insights. I’ve always believed in the saying “practice makes perfect” and as great as our classes at Berkeley are, they can’t replace practice and experience in the real world. I’m also seeking a sense of fulfillment since growing up I idolized the researchers and engineers at research teams such as Google X and Microsoft. If I have the opportunity to help work on research and I can say that I contributed to a project, it would be a dream come true.
","Teamwork to me is all about filling a role. Growing up playing baseball and basketball, you can’t win by yourself nor can you just run around trying to do everything. But at the same time, that doesn’t mean to constrict yourself to what’s defined. Even now working as part of the security team at Bampfa, I’m still learning what teamwork is. There are times when I should be very proactive and take matters into my own hands, but I also know when to get a supervisor involved. This is also one of the main things I want to gain from participating in Discovery Research, and that’s to see how far I can push myself with my current set of knowledge.

Especially as the environment continues to change in response to human interactions on Earth, I believe we need to make data more available to the public. Not only to provide a tool for policymakers, but in order for the education and safety of every person. I have previous experience working with environmental data sets at the PlanetOS hackathon,as we attempted to elucidate political issues in Iraq and its neighboring countries in relation to environmental data, particularly in relation to flooding in the region. We also explored different methods of classification between natural occurring floods in the region and man made floods. I also believe I am a fit for this project due to my interest in web development. Most of my experience comes from backend web development with python and its django framework. I am also learning the intricacies of ruby on rails and I have begun to teach myself javascript and its frameworks for more front end and back end development. ",Environmental Health Estimator,"I firmly believe that there are two issues in regards to environmental data going into 2020, and those are data availability and accessibility. I especially agree that environmental exposure is being overlooked in relation to other environmental data available. With my experience in EPS as well as Nutri Science at Berkeley, our continued interactions with pesticides, micro plastics, and chemicals such as BPA are not only harmful to our environment but potentially to our health as well. I’m highly interested in this project due to how far spread these issues can become with pesticides leading to nutrition pollution and thus dead zones and how much plastic pollution has gone.

While trying to find my major, I thought about my interests. I considered art because that was something that I had always loved, and still do. Throughout high school, I loved to draw and paint and even attended a pre-college summer program where I studied painting. I also thought about sociology because I’m fascinated in learning about human society and inequalities. I had been to many different conferences across the nation with Amnesty International and wanted to learn more in an academic setting.

I am interested in machine learning and its applications towards various fields. I have been programming since I was 13 and kept trying to learn more about technology since then. For the past few years, I have always had one project or another that I was working so I could develop my programming capabilities, building web scrapers, web apps, and a few elementary AI programs. On a more personal note, I enjoy watching and playing basketball in my free time. I am a Nets fan because I grew up in Brooklyn and have been supporting them since their move to New York. I also like to binge shows (usually sitcoms) on Netflix and listen to music when I have time or am studying. I am not that musically talented, but recently picked up the harmonica because of its seemingly low commitment and fun nature. I sometime try to go to the gym but it is hard to make time as a student. I hope this gave a good perspective of who I am as a person and I am excited to hear back!","I hope to gain a greater appreciation for the field of data science by being part of a real-world project. Many of my previous exposures to data science have been part of classes I have taken, which forces projects into a series of small sub problems that I do for a grade rather than approaching innovative problems from the ground up. I have attempted to go beyond the classroom and try to teach myself some of the fundamental concepts of data science and machine learning in order to work on projects I think from the beginning to the end; however, I still want to take on more and complete more impactful projects that can affect other individuals rather than building a small program that no one will use besides myself. It would be a great learning experience to apply all that I learned in the classroom and in my free time to a real project that people will use. I am hoping that through the Data Science Discovery Program I can learn more about what data science is like and how it operates outside the classroom as well as contribute to a project that helps further our technological progress. ","I personally think the best approach to teamwork is based on thorough communication. Making sure everyone is on the same page about all the work that is being done by everyone within the team and the recent innovations in the field outside of the group is crucial to make sure everyone is optimally working. It makes sure that all teammates are up to date and no one is wasting time through miscommunications. Another important aspect is creating tasks that fit each person rather than giving random or generic tasks to the team. If people are interested or experienced in their assignments for the project they are going to work harder and create a better product than if they were given a task that they didn’t care for. It is crucial to fit the tasks for the people otherwise people won’t put in as much effort and deliver a worse result. Finally, the team should all be able to work together. If a team is arguing about trivial or unimportant topics, no productive work is going to be able to happen.",NASA data viz,"When I was little, I wanted to become an astronaut and explore the universe. As I grew up, that dream had slowly faded away; however, space had continued to interest me. Although I don’t believe that I will be the one piloting an aviary vehicle, I would be thrilled to help those who do through data science. I think the project itself is truly interesting, trying to investigate pilot behavior in these difficult simulations and using data science to analyze it. It would be an incredible project to work on and would love to see what the results show for this experiment. I also believe my skills align with what is required for this project since I have been programming in Python for a while now and have experience dealing with processing video feeds since I have built various vision systems for autonomous driving for my robotics team in Python. Hopefully, I can provide all that I have learned towards helping understand the behavior of these pilots during these simulations and contribute towards furthering our knowledge of flight paths.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"I am interested in economics and finance and would be thrilled to be part of a project that focuses on that. I typically enroll in econ classes to learn more about the field and currently plan to concentrate in it with my applied math degree. It would also be interesting to see how the results of the natural language processing turn out and I would love to see the outcome. I am sure looking at how politicians and the media portray cannabis will lead to some fluctuations to its market and I am eager to find out how they impact it. I believe my skills are quite applicable to this project because I am experienced in Python and have done projects involving data cleaning before. Tackling a project dealing with natural language processing sounds like a great learning experience since I have not done a lot within the field and want to learn more because of its prevalence in both research and industry, with products such as Alexa and Siri becoming prominent in our lives. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I know many people affected by various heart diseases and it is a horrible feeling to stand by and watch them suffer. I would love to be part of a team that is tackling the issue and will help save people from cardiovascular issues in the future.  By being part of this team, I can use all the data science I have learned and apply it towards creating a tool that will have a great impact on a large number of people. Being able to make that difference would be a great feeling and make me think that all the time I have spent learning will have been a good use of my time. The project itself sounds like a fun, experimenting with various cumulations of data in order to try to find what biological signals may be indicating heart issues.

In terms of data science, my last internship over summer 2019 taught me program management and how to deal with proprietary databases and how information is compiled and how to extract specific information and realize patterns with the help of Excel and SQL. During this time, I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of data science and the potential to optimize our world.","As data science can be such a broad field in which every industry can utilize its power, I want to participate in Discovery Research to investigate the types of data that I would enjoy dealing with. Even though I have some experience with data compilation, I want to gain more skills in the field of data science. I am a fast learner and have the tendency to teach things myself through work, so through this I can also create useful work and progress for Discovery Research.","Over my past experience with project management in Cal Construction and Biofuels Technology Club, I have realized my strengths in communication and problem-resolution. Even though there can be multiple ways to solve an issue at the individual level, it's also important to find the best solutions together and with discussion and execute them as soon as possible. However, neither should negate the other. My approach to teamwork is to be as transparent and open as possible in terms of sharing the work one is doing now and the problems they are encountering, no matter how small. A way to realize this is to practice having scrums where everybody can share vocally on the spot and there solutions or ideas can be quickly exchanged while spurring productivity and efficiency.",Anomaly detection in Solar Microgrids,"The existence of microgrids such as personal solar panels to be self-sufficient are an interesting alternative to the age of centralized power and grid, especially with the issue of electrical-caused wildfires in California's history. With the rapid advancement of technology like solar, more research needs to be done and more precautions need to be set in place to make sure our personal assets and communal assets are protected.

More specifically, I'm interested in applying data science to solve problems in other fields— I am especially fascinated by the opportunities in science, because from previous exposure to those areas I have found that there is a lot of potential for meaningful impact. I have previously worked on a computational biology project focused on modeling the human gut microbiome through an agent-based technique. I found the experience incredibly meaningful because it allowed me to apply my computer science knowledge to a real-world problem that could ultimately impact the healthcare field as well as improve people's lives. I continued to explore the intersection of technology and healthcare through another project I did over the summer with a startup, this time using OpenCV to help track blood vessels in the retina to aid in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy. This opportunity was ultimately very impactful for me as well because I saw an even closer bridge between computer science / data science and solving healthcare problems for the real world. Since then, I have been deeply interested in using data science to tackle problems in not only biology, but other fields as well (I also have great interest in physics, and the applications there). Ultimately, the power that data science gives to model and infer new insights has always been fascinating to me.","I hope to apply my data science skills to solving real world problems in science and business. I am excited by the prospect of contributing to a data research project because I want to make an impact on some of the data challenges facing society today. In addition, I hope to gain more research experience as well as experience working on a team with other researchers. Project experience outside the classroom can be messy at times, but ultimately invaluable. I have really enjoyed all the outside CS/DS projects I have worked on so far because they allow me to creatively problem solve and address real world problems— I hope to continue pursuing opportunities like these through the discovery research program! It will be enriching to apply my data science knowledge to new domains and see what impact I can make to the challenges we face in those areas.","I think the most important aspect of teamwork is simply good communication. If people are on the same page with regards to their goals and interests, the team will have a good chance at succeeding no matter what the team's goal is. It is also good to play to people's strengths and let team members contribute what they are best at. Again, having good communication is key— it is about making sure that no one is being misinterpreted, and everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas as well as concerns for the project. Sometimes people end up contributing what others believe as too little or too much, in which again communication plays an important role because frustration and tension can build over time. What I really enjoy about teamwork in general is that there is a lot of opportunity to really combine the strengths of every member, and ultimately build a great product or solve a challenging problem.

One past summer, I joined the Stanford AI Lab. My group’s project was to use NLP to aid disaster relief. Unfamiliar with their coding environment in Python and overall framework, I was overwhelmed by the vast amount of information and embarrassed by how little I knew compared to my teammates. However, there was so much new knowledge to explore that I soon found myself motivated by the desire to learn more about how AI can be applied to the real world. So, I asked my mentors for help, and spent extra time each day to better understand the code and logic. I eventually overcame my self-doubt, and my progress allowed me to contribute more to the team. 

After noticing that we were stuck on finding an appropriate classifier that would boost our overall accuracy, I volunteered to take the lead. I held regular meetings with my teammates and mentors to discuss the different possibilities, even though I had ideas already formed in my mind, I still made sure to discuss different ideas my other teammates came up with. This way, I ensure that everyone is on the same page, and our ultimate approach is the best possible one. We had many instances of progress and setbacks, but in the end, we decided to test Naive Bayes and had a ~95% accuracy. Indeed, my challenge of lacking advanced knowledge, which I thought would prevent me from breaking through in teamwork, provided me with the opportunity and motivation to learn and eventually, lead.",Kiwibot delivery robots,"As a student, I've experienced the problems that Kiwibot had, and one of them was the delay of delivery time. College students are busy, and having an exact delivery time will allow them to plan their days better.

I felt cold from his absence, but I couldn’t let it show: it was weighing down my mother. I needed to help her. At the coin laundry where she worked, I would fill up the vending machines, carrying buckets of coins. At home, I made sure my brother finished his schoolwork before I finished mine. When I saw her smile after she saw my report card, it propelled my desire to do well at school and receive higher-level education. 

As I took more STEM courses, I felt joy in solving math problems and spent my free time on Coding Bat coding simple methods. I wished to learn more about math topics and computer science languages that weren’t covered in our high school curriculum so I applied to an all-tuition-guaranteed summer program called Carnegie Mellon University’s Summer Academy for Math and Science (SAMS). During these 6 weeks at Carnegie Mellon, I was able to focus more on my passion and get a taste of what on-campus life might be like.

Through this project, I had a glimpse of how we can use data to figure out the cost difference between using donor and porcine kidneys, effects on the economy, and the estimated year the porcine kidneys will be available in the market. This experience helped draw out the incredible impact data science has on our contemporary world and in the future. However, since this report was done by a group of seniors in high school, we were unsure of whether we were heading in the right direction. I wish to gain a professional insight on how data science is being used today. Furthermore, I hope to learn how coding is involved with manipulating and arranging large amounts of data. Although my experience with data science is minimal, I know that my experience in AP Computer Science A, AP Statistics, and sciences (AP Biology, AP Chemistry) will aid in the research.","Having experience as a leader of many clubs and extracurricular activities, I thrive as someone who can work with many different personalities and lead a sea of different viewpoints. Therefore, I believe that my strength is leading or listening, depending on the situation that’s given to me.

I wish to research which factory releases the most pollutants and the difference between the effects pollutants. Using this data, I want to be able to gather information on the population that is impacted the most and to find the reason why this population is impacted (geographical location, genetics). This research can help give the public a deeper understanding on the impact pollution has on humans and on animals.
I hope to bring my future children to the beach with a clear blue sky and I know that it is our generation's responsibility to make this happen. ",Automated Water Purification,"I read an article of how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considered tightening the drinking water standard for arsenic to as low as 3 ppb, but set the standard at 10 ppb because of cost reasons. I was irritated about how a person's health was exchanged for money -- there is no safe level for this toxin. As part of this project, my ultimate goal is to reduce the amount of arsenic in the water supply by creating a low-cost filter that can be easily implemented. However, I believe that it is important to spread awareness on the levels of arsenic within our water system. I wish to create an easy way to test and display the levels of arsenic in our water. I believe that it is important to make the testers easily accessible, low in cost, and harmless to the environment. Water should be accessible and no one should have to risk their health when drinking something that is essential to our life.

Although my own family did not have a telephone, I have written an algorithm to detect heart disease. When my uncle first introduced me to the computer in his office, he had no idea I would go on to build a full-fledged personal assistant.  Magnetically drawn to the might and magic, I routinely undertook the seven-mile journey to visit my uncle by foot or by bicycle.

This tireless urgency to understand computers and bring them to the next level led me to develop systems that engage real-world issues. Enthusiastic about the potential contained within artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, I completed my first long-term research experiment building an autonomous robot with a research group at IIT BOMBAY and published articles in the fields of robotics and AI. I have also written an algorithm to detect heart disease, and I created a full-fledged personal assistant. While the art of programming enables me to bring my ideas to fruition, it is the opening for life-changing impact that generates my ideas and fuels my drive. A dash of intuition, creative spark, theoretical knowledge, and judicious engineering calculations allow me to create programs that improve others’ lives.","The collective experiences over the past ten years have inspired me to pursue a career in computer science, pioneering machine learning technology to improve other people’s lives and to support those in under-resourced communities. Through Discovery Research, I am excited to be a part of the next evolutions of computing technology. Informatics is already part of everything we do, and it gives us the capacity to solve complex problems. From the human genome project to environmental monitoring, Discovery Research will help me to understand data science breakthroughs in the sciences, engineering, business, and medicine.It will ignite my love of learning and push me to continue growing in radical new directions. It is challenging and dynamic, logical and creative, powerful and full of potential. ","As a house captain and school head boy, I collaborate with other students to solve problems, answer questions, and increase our work efficiency. During my captainship, I worked closely with school cabinets to organize events, encourage student engagement, and enforce school discipline. We share in our struggles, but we also celebrate our individual and group achievements. Our collaborative efforts led our house to win most of our intra- and inter-school competitions, from athletics and debates to quiz bowls and art contests. Through leading our team in working closely together, I have come to see how each person’s work experiences, educational backgrounds, and creative impulses play important roles in the group and contribute to its accomplishments. 

Last year, I was a paid employee at the tech firm Bluebird Infotech, where I worked alongside employees of diverse backgrounds from around the country. In this business environment, I learned the value of collective brainstorming and the power of our combined efforts. Group members share their diverse perspectives, build on each other’s ideas, and compensate for one another’s weaknesses. It is amazing how much people can achieve when they do not worry about who gets the credit. When people apply their unique skills to a common task, they often create more effective solutions than any one person alone.

After years of broadening my academic pursuits from oncological research to healthcare economics to social entrepreneurship, I realized that data science unifies all of these disciplines. With an astounding percentage of the world's data being generated in just the past few years, I am thrilled at the potential to harness all this information to drive profound social changes. For example, biomedical research in fields such as biomarker discovery is now heavily reliant on high throughput sequencing data, electronic healthcare records provide avenues into personalized care, and homeless relief initiatives are starting to be assessed by data-driven outcomes research.
Within Berkeley’s student community, the next few years mark the turning point of our academic trajectories.  However, rather than weighing the virtues of various fields as if my current choices will define my career, I hope to provide meaningful insights into these fields such that my career defines them.","I believe that the “Discovery” emphasis of this program aligns with my virtues as an exploratory scholar. Equipped with foundational data analytics skills, along with the experience of translating this knowledge into meaningful outcomes for molecular biology research, I hope to broaden my applications of these skills into other fields that I care about. For example, I am intrigued by the UCSFs project on clinical trials for Crohn’s disease therapeutics. Working more directly to answer clinically relevant issues, especially for such a notoriously incurable disease, is a natural expansion of my data analysis for basic research purposes. I am also thrilled by the prospect of working long-term on the SF-YEAH youth homelessness initiative, which is a higher-level data acquisition and infrastructure building project. 
Aside from my interest in certain projects, I value the clear directives that project leaders will provide. Furthermore, my former research experiences have been done in more of a biological setting, so I also welcome the prospect to collaborate with other data scientists with varied backgrounds.
In short, the Discovery Research program offers me the perfect environment for growth as an aspiring biomedical innovator, social entrepreneur, and scholar.
","When making collaborative efforts in a fast-paced environment, one of the most essential attributes for team members to share is empathy, and a leader must encourage efforts to understand one another’s emotions. I learned to value empathy following a critical mistake managing a team for a consulting project: I micromanaged those who I deemed “slackers”. Hoping to onboard everyone, I failed to consider possible mental health issues with a team member and constantly called them to update them on project developments and tangential assignments that they could try. I should have, instead, noticed that this individual was overworked and my nagging provided them with little room for creative liberties. When I finally realized my mistake, I had an open and refreshing conversation with said individual. I gave the individual the option to take the rest of the semester off, and it was their choice how to continue to contribute to the project if so desired. As a result, this individual took some time off and proceeded to perform well designed and efficient research, which our client singled out and commended. From this experience, I learned that everyone has extenuating circumstances, and to be more emotionally conscious when singling individuals out for feedback. Most importantly, I learned that empathy is a seed that, when nurtured with open communication, yields the fruits of productive and genuine relationships.",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,"The current biopharmaceutical industry is broken such that competing firms produce drugs with extraordinarily similar mechanistic actions. Because placebo-controlled trials provide enough data for FDA approval, the lack of comparative effectiveness data prompts the need to assess which competing drugs are better, for which people. 
By assessing the clinical trial data of patients in a retrospective observational study, the immense costs of randomized controlled trials may be curtailed, enabling a more streamlined approach for precision medicine. Currently, with a poorly standardized clinical trial reporting system, I foresee issues with the accuracy and validity of datasets aggregated from multiple clinical studies. I am also interested in developing and applying the statistical techniques required to conduct a meta-analysis for comparative effectiveness studies; I hope to learn how to pool various effects estimates with various statistical models. 
In terms of precision medicine, I am intrigued by the possibility that some models may soon predict which therapies are most effective based on their healthcare data. Currently, the predictive power of biomarkers, especially data generated by digital health devices, shows much promise in this field. However, platforms that access and process these biomarker data are limited. For the time being, I am curious to assess the predictive power of conventional patient data.
For these reasons, I hope to join this project to help achieve data validity with analytics technologies and select relevant clinical information for these studies. 
",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"When shadowing oncologists a few years back, I recognized that a common grievance was the lack of consistency in pathology reports. Oftentimes, these reports contained very much free text, at the time that I shadowed, computerized clinical decision support wasn’t able to read digital EHR data. This meant that oncologists wasted time manually sifting through these reports. For this reason, I believe that NLP has great potential to radically change the way oncologists respond to diagnosis, cancer grading, and other assessments. 
Natural learning processing, in my opinion, has intriguing long term applications to clinical reports because of the clinical utility to freely written human writings. For example, pathologist’s freedom to express their insights outside a traditional pathological report framework is crucial to help advance patient outcomes. On the physician side, it is always nice to be able to refer to human opinion rather than a machine structured report. However, NLP will convert these freely written notes to a machine-readable format, from which useful clinical data can be extracted. Ultimately, such structured data could be used to train a machine classifier to assist with clinical decision making. Because of my perception that NLP will have a drastic impact on the clinic, I hope to join this project as a data scientist.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"This project addresses a topic that is dear to my heart: youth homelessness. In high school, after leading homeless relief initiatives in the streets of DC, I attempted to start a program involving marginalized youth, to provide them with after school activities and such. However, my organization failed to attract interest from these individuals, presumably because what I thought they were interested in wasn’t aligned with my planned activities.

Fast-forwarding to my current interest in homeless relief initiatives, my friends and I started brainstorming a platform that predicts the long-term efficacy of homeless relief programs using various predictors. Our current goal is to acquire data that follows homeless individuals longitudinally through such programs and find channels through which we can source this data. The key goal is to find program features that align with common demographic features and predict long term well-being, beyond simply finding housing. This project has a similar goal in terms of data acquisition design and consolidating data for analysis. Better yet, this project passion for homeless relief, especially in youth. For these reasons, I am greatly interested in volunteering my experience as a data scientist, as well as my compassion as a human being.

Although adapting to a new environment was very hard at first, I think the move left me at an advantage. Living in two different cities has allowed me to learn and adapt to different cultures, different types of people, and different mentalities. Moving to Florida also allowed me to pursue one of my passions- marine science. I was able to work as a Chief Marketing officer for a non-profit organization called Fishing for Families in Need, working to teach children at underdeveloped schools about marine science. I even conducted my own research on jellyfish and phytoplankton populations one summer. Moreover, I am very passionate about food (especially desserts), and I started my own food blog that now has over 26,600 followers.
    I originally came into Berkeley as pre-med, but when I tried a CS class, I enjoyed it very much and decided to change my track. This past summer I had a chance to intern as a data scientist at a non-profit organization called Changing the Present. Going forward in my data science career, I am very interested in learning more about AI/ machine learning. The topic fascinates me since it is so upcoming and new.
","By participating in Discovery Research, I would like to enhance my data science skills that I have learned through the Berkeley courses, such as data manipulation, data cleaning, and data analysis. I believe that in order to be fully immersed in the world of data science, I need to work on projects outside of just the classes I take. By applying my skills to new projects and learning through the seniors at the program, I know I can gain valuable experience that I would be able to apply to later jobs. Data science is a skill, and I hope to apply these skills to projects that I am passionate about, while also contributing meaningful work to the project I am apart of. Moreover, I would like to expose myself to topics that I have not yet learned in a classroom setting, as I believe the best way to learn is to apply the information.
","The way I work best with a team is by starting off with a simple idea or ideas and improving on these ideas as the team develops the project further. From my experience, teams work best when they are able to build off of one another's ideas. Sometimes a teammate may think of great ideas or see something from a different perspective that I could not have come up with alone. For me, it is important to take everyone's thoughts into consideration because being dismissive to another's idea can negatively effect that person, which can later delay the performance of the team. However, constructive criticism is important because not every idea someone comes up with is going to be ""good,"" and this criticism can help them improve their thought process for the future.
",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"The cannabis market is something that has interested me for the past couple of years because it is so controversial. While it has many positive capabilities, including being able to ease the pain of some diseases, many people believe intaking cannabis can be harmful. The industry is such a booming business that Marijuana Business Factbook predicts the economic impact to be $77 billion by 2022. This project would be an amazing opportunity to enhance my data cleaning skills, while working on a project I am extremely passionate about. I have experience in economics, and it would be a fantastic experience combining my knowledge of economics and data science in order to extract the most precise information. My passion for learning more about the cannabis industry would bring a motivational attitude to the work environment. 

",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"This project interests me very much because I worked in a pathology lab in the summer of 2017, preparing 60+ tissue samples a day for biopsy testing in order to ensure the tissue was in good order for the pathologist to analyze. Preparing biopsies is essential in order to deeply understand the intricacies of biomedical biopsies, including cancer research and defective tissue. When I worked in this lab, I had never taken a computer science or data science class before, and I never understood how the topics could even be applied to pathology, so it would be amazing to exercise my analyzing skills to this subject a couple of years later.
Moreover, my grandmother unfortunately passed away from cancer, so it would mean a lot to be able to work on a project that allows me to use my data science skills to help reduce cancer mortality in patients. It amazes me that data analytics can have as large of an impact as saving lives. Working on such a meaningful project would be an inspiring and extremely rewarding experience.

",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"Working on a data science project involving the Supreme Court interests me because the Supreme Court makes decisions that impact the average person’s daily life. For example, in 1954 the Brown Vs. Board of Education case banned race-segregated schools, forever changing American education laws. In one of my projects for last semester, I built a Spam email classifier, identifying which emails were spam Vs. not spam. I believe that I could apply a very similar process for this project by using feature engineering to find important features in the Supreme Court documents. This could help analyze which cases the Supreme Court deems as “important.” This project excites me because it could help people predict what cases the Supreme Court will take on, or even what to write in the case in order to have a higher chance of the case being chosen.",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,Facebook,N/A,1,

In fact, last year, I entered Berkeley with the intent of declaring Biology as my major, but by the second semester, I ventured into technology. After attending a health-themed Hackathon, ever since I came back, I have been finding many parallels between health and technology. For the past year, I have been finding ways to use my Data Science experiences to contribute towards health. A few examples of projects I had worked on this past year include creating a chatbot Electronic Health Record system (https://devpost.com/software/littlebirdy), configuring a machine-learning algorithm to automatically detect beta cells in lab images, or ideating ways to combat food insecurity in our campus community using an app. All of these experiences makes me more certain that I want to work towards integrating Data Science and health more in the future.","Through participating in Discovery Research, I wish to gain more experience with integrating Data Science with health in a more long-term setting. The past projects that I had been involved in were very short-term, spanning from a few days to a few weeks. I believe if I were to work on a project for a semester or even longer, I would be able to better develop my skills and create a more effective product at the end. Additionally, working in a research setting would give me the opportunity to learn from more experienced faculty and students. I also value the resources given to students who are part of the Data Science Scholars program, and believe that they really support students who feel underrepresented in the field. Because of the support, I feel that this program is very unique in motivating students, and will also give me the encouragement to put in my 100% when working on projects. ","When working in a team, I tend to be the creative member. When working on a project, I believe you need to think outside the box. I always love ideating when it comes to hackathons, small projects, or daily tasks. A recent example would be last summer when I worked at a Diabetes Lab at Rutgers Medical School in New Jersey. One of my initial tasks was to work with other undergraduates to manually count alpha cells on imaged mice pancreases. To give you an idea of how tedious and long the task was, there were an upwards of 1300 cells in each image, and each imaging set had at least 300 images. Fed up of the constant eye-strain and clicking, I started to look for ways to automate the image set. Looking at other computer programs, image analysis papers, and labs and their work with other organs, I found a bunch of different methods that I played around with and I was working with the other undergraduates to make this process even more effective. By the end of the summer, my team and I completely automated the counting and cut lab time drastically. Just by thinking out of the box, we were able to save so much time in the lab and make time for students to do other more hands-on things in research.",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"A current, real-work challenge I am passionate about is Cancer detection and prevention. Certain cancers can be based upon the environment one lives in or genetics, where certain genes are more prevalent in one ethnicity over another. That being said, many cases can be avoided if someone’s lifestyle was improved or many cases could be detected earlier on by conducting regular screenings on certain communities. Cancer is a very common disease today, and after seeing two family members battle against it, this project description stood out to me the most. I feel the most passionate about the subject, as well as its community-based approach with data.  ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"Cardiovascular Disease is very prominent in the South Asian community, and I have seen its consequences too many times.

I can't claim to know what I want to do with these skills, but I am excited to explore them.","As I stated above, I am excited to explore different interests. I learned of Berkeley's Data Science program just before the start of the Fall Semester, and I was immediately intrigued. The opportunity to combine concepts from statistics, probability, and computer science to accomplish tasks with very real-world, practical benefits excited me. I took the intro computer science course my first semester, which helped me develop fundamental skills in Python and program design. I am now signed up for Data 8, as well as Stat 88 and CS 61B. However, I am eager to apply these skills, and the Discovery Research program presents a perfect opportunity to do so, while also collaborating with peers who I'm sure I can learn much from.","My first real experience with teamwork (beyond group projects in school) came in high school, when I, along with some of my friends, founded a competitive Model United Nations team. Over the course of three years, we built it into a program with over 100 active members, and received the distinction of being named a Top 25 Team in North America. As one might imagine, none of that was easy work -- but it was remarkably satisfying to work closely with our ever-growing team to accomplish the feat. Over the course of those three years, I learned the overwhelming importance of communication and reliability -- staying up to date with all involved members, and delivering on a promise. I carry these two tenets of good teamwork with me today, and apply it to any group I am a part of.",Student Success Analytics Platform,"In high school, I conducted a statistics research project to determine if there was a correlation between a student's personality type (as determined by the Myers Briggs Indicator) and their success in school. The results revealed a strong correlation between a student's approach to organizing information (strictly vs. loosely) and their achievement in the classroom.

This position my first research/internship related position and severely pushed my outside my comfort zone. As a freshly graduated high school senior, I was tasked with modeling cell states through stochastic methods such as Markov chain models. I started off trying to use Excel to create such a model. One must bear in mind that, at the time of this internship, I was a freshly graduated high school senior and this was my first exposure to stochastic modeling. After realizing Excel was not suited for such a model, I moved on to learning Python from scratch. Eventually, over the course of two weeks, I designed a basic Markov chain model and used the numpy library to visualize this simulated cell state data. The experience left me shocked at the power of data science in prediction and modeling. My curiosity and interest in learning more spiked and I daresay Berkeley has fed this drive for knowledge ever since.","I would like to gain exposure to data science related research as I've spent the past 3 years studying others discoveries and believe I am sufficiently prepared to assist and perhaps even have some of my own discoveries with a group of like-minded individuals. I hope to use the knowledge and experience I've gained so far to discover and understand new ideas which further the field. In addition, I look forward to meeting not only individuals who share my passion for data science but also individuals who are passionate about other topics and might perhaps open my eyes to new perspectives and trains of thought. ","My approach to teamwork can be described as enthusiastic and methodical. I’ve frequently worked on teams in the past for a variety of different projects and, as a result, I feel quite comfortable in a team setting. I believe that there are two main factors to create a good team. The first factor is self awareness. In order to achieve a goal, team members must know their strengths and weaknesses and how they can help the team the most. The second factor is the chemistry between the team members.

I believe that teamwork can be the most rewarding when each group member agrees upon the work that is delegated to each team member; this makes sure that everyone is supportive and VALUES each others work instead of thinking one member did more or less work than the other. In addition to this, having a clear agenda for the meeting and a plan-of-action to follow after the meeting is critical to have a successful project.

Cancer research has been a strong field of interest for me since high school because of how close I was to people impacted by it. Therefore, in high school, I applied and got selected for the Emperor Science Award (a program that educated students about Cancer and encouraged students to conduct cancer research projects with a mentor). Through this project, I worked with a professor in the Hepatology division; a part of our plan included surveying physicians about reducing the risk of liver cancer by improving screening of risk patients of Hepatitis B. This was a very inspiring project for me because it made me aware of the preventative methods doctors and patients can take for this problem. Moreover, it introduced me to the data analysis techniques that researchers use to determine what trends exist and the possible correlations/causations for that data. After working on this project, I became very much interested in the healthcare industry and especially cancer care. ",NASA data viz,"I am interested in this project because I have recently started flying for college purposes: to go home for the break and come back for the term. After watching so many movies, documentaries, and news stories about plane incidents and pilot heroes, there have been sometimes, when I am traveling on these planes, where I think about the psychological nature of pilots and how they react in challenging situations. I wonder how they cope with the stress of handling a plane and the lives of so many passengers when everyone is in a panicking state of mind. This makes me so much more captivated towards the mission of this project.  Also, I love software, and anything that has to do with building a specific tool to analyze and output useful data is quite fascinating to me. Additionally, I have spent some time learning Python and taking a course that is structured based on Python. Although I was able to acquire this programming language, applying it to a real project makes the most significant difference in learning the core power of that language.

In the past, I have worked with a Hepatology professor to research reducing the risk of liver cancer by improving screening of risk patients of Hepatitis B. What made me become so engaged in this project is the nature of the data and the results we were able to obtain. I did not know much about the topic before starting my research, and so the results were very new for me to analyze. I am very interested in investigating the effectiveness of different treatments for Crohn's disease because it aligns with my goals of involving engineering, data science, and medicine to make a significant impact on society. The results of this investigation can be so valuable to physicians and drug companies to save many lives. Since this project hasn't been taken up in the gastroenterology/inflammatory bowel disease field yet, it is a great opportunity to approach this with creative ideas to make strong advancements.

From a young age, I was passionate about guitar, learning at the age of four. I channeled my energy through this instrument and used it as a means of distraction and peacefulness. It taught me the principles of focus and drive, which I try to employ into everything I do today. Alongside guitar, I began garnering a passion for NBA Basketball, particularly the Boston Celtics from when I lived there. Watching and analyzing games and video, my passion for the sport led me to love the field of data analytics. When combining passion and principle, you get someone who has the determination to be a leader, and that’s what I discovered in myself from a young age. It was an innate feeling to want to be the talkative one who guides others. In the face of a leadership opportunity, I never passed one up. Whether I was the one trying to teach my peers how to play The Clap by Steve Howe on the guitar or explaining to friends how I logistic regression predict NBA teams’ records, passion, principle, and leadership were always present and will continue to be.  ","I did my first real, long-term research project the summer after my sophomore year of high school, where I was building software to optimize web development. From this moment on, I was hooked on the idea of researching a topic of interest and bringing originality to how I wanted to approach the topic. Through Discovery Research, I wish to continue building on my research foundations and complete my first-ever research project as a college student. Knowing the amazing resources that Cal offers in terms of research, being able to work with state-of-the-art technology and world-renowned professors would really help me extend my research knowledge and help me hone in on a certain domain of data science that I can enjoy and pursue in the future. I also want to gain an overall understanding of the world around me through this experience. By this, I mean that I want to pursue a research project in which I will be able to see and understand the impact that my work will have on the world, or simply gain a deeper understanding of some facet of the world that I didn’t know before. I want to grow my intellectual curiosity. ","Self-learning is valuable for self-growth but learning from others is critical for diversifying one’s own approach to life. With billions of people in this world, all with different mindsets, thought processes, and ideas, it would be foolish not to partake in conversation with as many people as possible, and work together with other people to accomplish something amazing. The amalgamation of brain power can serve as a powerful tool for success. With teamwork, my approach is simple, but effective: Developing solid relationships between team members first puts the team on pace to be effective. Prioritize the emotional intelligence first, and everything else will fall into place properly. Having been a participant and leader in several activities requiring teamwork, the pitfalls always seem to occur when there’s tension amongst team members themselves. Respecting everyone, on the other hand, has shown to increase the entirety of the team’s confidence and determination to succeed. Once the team chemistry is at its highest, the final step is for an authoritative leadership figure to bring a sense of organization, accountability, dedication, and motivation to the team and its members in order for the team to be a cohesive unit and accomplish what they want.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"Cannabis has made its mark on the political and economic landscape of the US, especially after its legalization in various states. In places like California, new and innovative Cannabis start-ups have emerged, creating all sorts of new products as well as distribution techniques. This means that there is a lot of emerging data regarding product description, safety, quantity sold at, and more. This information is important for many reasons: the government can use it when thinking of new ways to enforce regulation or increase leniency. It also gives insight on the types of economic competition burgeoning within certain pockets of the US like Los Angeles. With this research, we’ll be able to uncover the politics, culture, and business competitiveness when it comes to the Cannabis industry. Having worked with analyzing and pre-processing large datasets before in prior data science/deep learning research projects, I find it extremely interesting how much diverse information clean, processed datasets like these can provide, and the kinds of statistical conclusions and new insights that can be drawn with a burgeoning field like Cannabis and its impact on the economic and political landscape of the US. I hope to gain valuable insight on this topic and discover for myself how Cannabis is leading to new start-ups and businesses. ",Anomaly detection in Solar Microgrids,"One prime example of data science application in the real world is electronic testing. Companies who create millions of units of tech products need a way to optimize costs and revenue, and thus need to be able to deal with anomaly detection. Not every unit produced will be up to standards, but we can use data science and machine learning models to classify units as clear for shipping out or not by means of anomaly detection. I’m interested in this project because I see its real-world application. My father works at TE Connectivity, and he manages the part of the company that produces industrial cables and wires for large companies. One day, he asked me to help him understand some data science concepts that he wasn’t familiar with. His team was using linear regression and random forest classifiers in order to determine where in the production of a particular wire an anomaly would result in a wire not passing inspection and testing. After analyzing their models, datasets, and overall solution architecture, I realized that I was really interested in anomaly detection for products, and this could be the perfect opportunity for me to learn more about it.",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"I love seeing how my research can impact the real world, and this project is a prime example of this. Currently, environmental policy is a huge factor in the political landscape as well as the future health our world’s environment. It’s important that as a society, we begin taking real steps forward to mitigate issues that our environment is facing. This starts with getting into the nitty-gritty of what is really causing these environmental issues. What better way to aggregate this data than using data science techniques! By having an extensive platform to display datasets and environmental information in a visually fascinating way, policy makers and advocates will have an easier time picking data they want in order to form the strongest arguments/policies that will serve to better the environment in the long run.

I was born in Southern California but was brought up in Petaluma California. I have been very active within my community racking up 900+ hours within my high school tenure. I actively volunteered in the Petaluma Valley Hospital and the Sunrise Senior Center. By the time I graduated, I became a role model in my community as people recognized me for the amount of work I had done to save my community. During 2017 and 2018, wildfires ravaged a large part of my community shutting down close to eight different medical centers in northern California. The Tubbs fire burned down a large part of Santa Rosa, CA a community that we in Petaluma could see destroyed right in front of our eyes. I was a part of a medical team that evacuated medical patients to locations such as UCSF and Stanford Medical. That week, I didn’t know if either the Atlas fire or the Tubbs fire would reach my hometown, but I gave up my time helping my community that was on the brink of devastation. By my senior year, people in my community looked at me not as a graduate but as a volunteer who gave everything to protect those in pain both inside and outside of my community.","I wish to pursue a minor degree in Data Science. I believe that through the experience of the Discovery Projects, I could gain more knowledge about programming, operating, graphing, and create a foundation of what Data Science really is and how it can not only apply to the computer science field but to other area I am interested in such as medicine and biology.","When I start to define teamwork, I have to begin with the first word: team. What does it mean to be a part of a team? A team is a group of people that are a part of a group because of their expertise in their field. For example, an NBA teams consisting of five Ray Allens would not be able to beat the Durant-Thompson-Curry Warriors primarily because every person in the team has a role they fulfill. A team is able to work together if every person in the group is able to efficiently complete their tasks properly.

For the longest time, from the first protest I experienced to the partnered creation of Wisconsin’s first Women’s March branch, activism was the sole axis for my dream to create change. 

But, where activism and political science are often controversial and subjective, data science introduces tangibility; whereas a purely activist dream to foster change is hard to grasp, one rooted in data science allows me to explore in depth, plucking apart the very issues I seek to affect. I find data fascinating in the way it describes the world, and it is how I choose to understand the worlds and issues I seek to create change in.","Through Discovery Research, I hope above all to gain new understanding of data science-based approaches to issues I am passionate about. While broad concepts and technical abilities are explorable by study, the experience of how data science works in junction with tangible problems that Discovery Research offers is not--this is something I find uniquely compelling. 

In addition to a strong interest in several research projects, I’m also heavily attracted by the introduction to the culture of doing data science that Discovery Research offers. Besides being able to learn data science research techniques and skills, I would be able to chat with other students, researchers, and possibly faculty to further understand what a data science career truly looks like, and to refine my own direction within one.","I prefer to work as part of a team, because I believe the best ideas are created in partnership with others. I particularly enjoy the creative environment that’s fostered when a team united by a common passion for the subject matter, but diversified by experiences and ideas, or perhaps even disciplines, comes together. 

To me, the most important factors when approaching teamwork are discussion and explicitness. Open discussion, whether that translates to modest controversy or the introduction of unorthodox ideas, initiating new lines of thinking, is to me one of the most valuable products of teamwork. A bit more practical is my belief in explicitness and readiness, reflected in clearly defined goals and roles, and responsibility to finish tasks when they are meant to be. While I especially enjoy being able to strategize and learn along with team members, once a plan is established, I enjoy working independently on my tasks as well.
",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"One of my most passionate interests in the field of activism is the issue of displacement, especially as I’ve come to the Bay Area and seen the rising rates and consequences of it. In the past I’ve worked on the boards of Beacon Refuge House and Bolton Refuge House, local homelessness relief centers, to address this issue on a personal/social level, but I’m eager to participate in a project that seeks to prompt change through a data-based approach. I’m incredibly motivated to work with data that has the potential to positively affect the displacement issue that affects so many of my peers and those in the community.

While the goal of this project is something I’m passionate about, the process is also something I’m exceedingly interested in. While I’ve worked with consolidating data into database-like structures in the past, the data was mostly singular-dimensioned. I’m excited to work with data that is so diverse, and to explore the most effective consolidation methods, in order to allow more productive exploration and the change I so wish to see. It would be deeply rewarding and interesting to work with my peers to tackle different approaches to this issue and reveal ways to work with a difficulty that is often present in this field.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"One of my most passionate interests in the field of activism is the issue of development of spaces of inclusion and intersectionality--in the past I’ve worked on the boards of Women’s March and Beacon House to address this issue on a personal/social level, but I’m eager to participate in a project that seeks to prompt change through a data-based approach. While this issue is truthfully not one that I’ve considered in the past, I now see this incredibly prominent gap and the implications of it, and thus the many positive changes that could branch off from an algorithm like this one. I’m incredibly motivated to work on a project that’s connected to an issue that I’m both deeply involved and passionate about.

While the goal of this project is something I’m very excited about, so is the process. I’ve worked with tools such as Google’s Perspective API in the past to explore how hate speech is classified and quantified, but building an algorithm from the ground up is something that is newer to me, and which I would be thrilled to learn about and explore. I am deeply interested in immersing myself in the specifics of how such an algorithm is built.",Right Wing Sheriffs,"Although now my major academic interest lies in the field of data science, much of my prior experience involves political science, and the junction between the two is one that I find particularly engaging. One of my most passionate interests in the field of activism is the issue of gun control--while I’ve previously worked with this topic on a social/community level, I’m eager to participate in a project that explores a specific cog of how this issue moves through the governmental system. I’m incredibly motivated to work with data that directly connects to so many issues I’m passionate about.

While the goal of this project is something I’m highly interested in, the process is also something that I’m excited to work with. I’m interested in seeing how the cross section between Constitutional sheriffs and other trends are quantified, and how these trends can be made into meaningful analysis for the public. Overall, I’m deeply attracted to both the scope and the undertaking of this project.

However, after being introduced to the field of data science and learning of its ability to expedite and streamline processes in many different industries, I now aspire to double major in Data Science and Computer Science. 
I’m especially interested in trying different clubs and learning about new areas of study. Last semester, I joined as an Operations Team member for the Bio-Business Initiative, where I coordinated mentorship and educational events about biology with underprivileged local high schools. My decision to join the BBI was driven in part by my developing interest in the growing field of biotechnology, and more specifically, in utilizing big data techniques to identify key risk areas as well as in medical diagnoses. I like being a member of this club because it provides unique opportunities for community service.
I also began an assistant role in research for the Berkeley Interdisciplinary Research Group on Privacy last semester, where I helped analyze and annotate the latest academic articles on privacy and its intersection with big data, science, healthcare, and law. I enjoyed working on this project because I was able to learn more about how different areas of industry intersect with the common problem of privacy.","Last semester, I was a research assistant for the URAP project for the Berkeley Interdisciplinary Research Group on Privacy. My tasks for that project included reading and writing about several academic journals on privacy and a topic of my choice. I chose to learn more about data science and how privacy has played an increasing role in developing new technologies and policies. My interest in data science only grew after reading articles on how big data is changing the world around us. 
By participating in Discovery Research, I hope to immerse myself in the world of data science and apply the skills I have developed in class and on projects to actual data to make a positive impact. I wish to gain more experience in coding and manipulating data. Additionally, I hope to learn more about how to collect, analyze, and visualize data. Big data is becoming increasingly relevant in today’s society, so I want to have relevant data science research experience to help me learn more about it.
","I value collaboration, cooperation, and respect. When working in a team, I make sure that all opinions are heard. For example, last semester, in my class UGBA 10, students were assigned a group of team members to compete in the Market Games Simulation. Each student was assigned a role- finance, marketing, CEO, and product management- and had responsibilities to fulfill each week for the team. For a team to be successful in market games, each student had to communicate with each other to make decisions as a whole in order to achieve the highest score. When the groups were assigned, I reached out to each of my teammates to arrange our first meeting. Throughout the 8 weeks of our market game simulation, I stepped up as a leader and arranged our weekly meetings to complete the deadlines together. When others could not attend, another member of my group and I picked up their work in order to meet deadlines, and I sent summaries of what we did at the meetings so others had an idea of what decision to make for their role. My approach to teamwork is making sure we work effectively and efficiently together. 
",Data Enabled Donations,"I am interested in this project because I want to learn more about utilizing data in the world to have a positive impact on people. As a student interested in operations research, I am drawn to this project’s goal of optimizing supply and demand of donations. Using mathematical models to solve problems has always been a passion of mine. 
I hope to apply my skills to solve relevant problems such as helping fight the repercussions following a disaster. Natural disasters cause not only physical damage, but emotional damage to the people affected. Thus, being able to help optimize the movement of donations would help alleviate the trauma associated with disasters. By contributing to the optimization of the supply and demand of physical donations, I would want to create a positive impact on those receiving items such as food or blankets more efficiently because it is important to take into account what type of resources each shelter needs. I hope to contribute to this research project to further develop my interest in academic research and my skills in data and computer science. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"The novelty of the cannabis industry adds to the challenge and the appeal of this project. With more research, we can have a better understanding of this new industry and how it will develop. The cannabis industry is unusual for a number of political and cultural reasons which is why the market competition will be particularly interesting to study. Additionally, cultural attitudes and the political climate towards cannabis are gradually changing which will add to the complexity of the market’s development.  	
I am interested in this project because I am passionate about learning more about the intersection of economics, data science, and society, and this project is a combination of the three. I have worked with large data sets before, and I hope to apply the skills I have developed and learn new techniques.  I have always been interested in utilizing technological resources to solve interdisciplinary problems, and this project would give me the opportunity to learn more about natural language processing, data science, and a unique US industry in pursuit of a driven goal. I hope to contribute to this research project to further develop my interest in academic research and my skills in data and computer science. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"	I am interested in this project because I want to learn more about utilizing data in the world of healthcare and science to have a positive impact on people. While working at CorTechs Labs, I learned more about the company’s MRI software that outputted numerical analyses of different cortical and subcortical regions of the brain. With a large database of numerical data, clinicians are able to compare the size of a patient’s brain regions with other patients with diagnosed diseases. Seeing how large amounts of data has helped clinicians in diagnosing diseases piqued my interest in learning more about the intersection of medicine and data science.
	I am interested in how this natural language software is being developed and implemented in analyzing pathology records. I am passionate about this project’s goal of reducing cancer mortality, and how it can positively impact those in need. I have always been interested in utilizing technological resources to solve interdisciplinary problems, and this project would give me the opportunity to learn more about natural language processing, AI, and data science in pursuit of a driven goal.  I hope to contribute to this research project to further develop my interest in academic research and my skills in data and computer science.

When it comes to coworkers who are experts or leaders, I'm always looking to pick their brains and understand the perspectives and tools that they hold.

For the sake of getting things done and keeping up with obsessive brainstorms, I like to keep things very organized and systematic. I have a series of notes where I progressively refine ideas until they are distilled into something I can fluently diagram, document, or debate.

In my free time, I like to sing a cappella, do classical Indian dance, make architectural sketches, and scour local thrift stores! I'm passionate about environmental initiatives and women in business/entrepreneurship. Last semester, I took Data 8, and discovered that I have an affinity for data science! I decided to take Data 88 this semester to continue exploring this subject and would like to gain more exposure through a research project. I also participated in a two-week entrepreneurship workshop sponsored by the Haas School of Business, and learned a little bit about what it takes to build and pitch a prototype. I spend the rest of my time working as an intern in the ASUC under Senator Sumrit Grewal to arrange career fairs and networking panels for members of the MEMSSA community. ","I hope participating in Discovery Research helps me delve deeper into what a large-scale research project entails, and allows me to expand my skill set in different coding languages. I would also like to gain exposure to the different ways that data science can apply to areas like business, public policy and environmental policy. Working closely with other undergraduate students and professionals passionate about the same causes would be an invaluable experience, and one that would help me learn more about what career I would like to pursue in the future. Since this project would run the course of the whole semester, I would be able to learn what conducting a relatively long-term research initiative is like, which is something I've never experienced before. I genuinely enjoyed the three projects that were part of the curriculum of Data 8, and would be extremely excited to explore the realm of more realistically-sized projects. Also, I would hope to build lasting connections with my fellow researchers, and ones that I could potentially use in the future. ","I've had over 5 years of experience in volunteering and working a job that required both interpersonal skills and the ability to collaborate. In this time, I've learned that in a team, every person's opinion should be equally valued. Regardless of who the designated 'leader' is, every person in a team should be open to opposing opinions and constructive criticism. I've also learned that good communication is key: without it, people are bound to misinterpret information and slow down the team. Although working together is important, time alone can also be valuable. In my experience, individual brainstorming sometimes leads to breakthroughs in whatever the team is working on. Most importantly, each team member must maintain faith in the team's ability to succeed. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"According to the project description, this project primarily uses python, which I have experience with from my time taking AP Physics C (VPython) and Data 8. One of the primary objectives of the project is to take complex data sets and make them more readable and relevant. I did this on a smaller scale in Data 8, and came to enjoy the process of refining larger data sets into parts that were actually useful and informative. It would be interesting to use these data sets to inform real research as well. The project description also states that researchers will apply modern techniques to find trends in product descriptions. In Data 8, one of the first experiences I had with the power of data science was with finding trends in writing. We looked at the occurrence of certain words in a book and were able to figure out some general aspects of the plot from the placement of these words. I think it would be interesting to apply this same concept to product descriptions in the real world. Also, it is a unique opportunity to be able to explore the dynamics of the cannabis industry, which is a relatively unexplored area in data science. ",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"This project is interesting to me because it intends to aggregate data from across the country in an effort to inform policymakers about the environmental status of each state. This project combines my passion of environmentalism with public policy, and has the potential to make a real change in the policy that affects the environment. With the execution of this project, people will be more informed about the real effects of pollution on people living in individual states, and will therefore be able to make more intelligent decisions. I would love to be a part of this project as it would allow me to make a tangible effort to make data and information more accessible in the realm of environmental policy. ",Automated Water Purification,"The main objective of this project is to create an app that can remotely purify water. This interests me because of the past experience I've had with developing a prototype for an application in the entrepreneurship workshop I participated in. I collaborated with my team in designing the base product, receiving customer feedback, refining the prototype, and presenting the final product during this workshop. Although I never completed the app, I will continue to develop it in my Berkeley SkyDeck Fellowship. This research project combines my interest in developing new applications with my desire to combat the effects of climate change, one of which includes restricted access to clean water. Being able to remotely purify water would allow this product to be used anywhere in the world. I would greatly enjoy taking part in this project because of its potential to help people around the world.

Besides Data Science and Computer Science, I have a background in Media Studies and Sociology with interests in studying Media history and Social theory.

In terms of of my life outside of academics, my youth memories in a small city of China where critically lacks education resources make me become a faithful believer of unlimited potentials of human beings. That was the time that I saw my fellow students striving under poor conditions for any opportunities of learning and since then I knew I would always value the most human empathy and compassion and diverse environment such as the one in the data science community.","The way that the Discovery Program opens to all kinds of partnerships and addresses various data challenges is what I admire the most. With the opportunity of hands-on experience, I wish to hone my data analysis and software engineering skills as well as people skills by working collaboratively with teammates.

Most importantly, I wish to achieve a sense of accomplishment by contributing my knowledge to the data science community and thus impacting the world and the people we care about.","There was once a project where my team was building a web-based routing application of Berkeley. I believe that the best ideas are developed in partnership with others and during our project, I learned to evaluate the individual strengths of my associates, to listen to their needs, and to coordinate my efforts to support theirs. We developed map restoring, zoom functionality and implement shortest-path routing in our app. We had been working on the project seven days a week from nine to nine together and I’m energized by team dynamics and excited as I witness the progress we make towards our goals. There were frustrations when we were stuck on the implementation of an Autocomplete system where a user types in a partial query string, like “Mont”, and we should return a list of locations that have “Mont” as a prefix.

This major has thrown many, many curveballs in form of class assignments during the year and a half that I’ve been attending this university. But with near sleepless nights comes community. I found one with fellow students and the course staff.

Thanks to this major, my strengths, tenacity and collaboration skills, grew. These are best exemplified through my favorite project: the Encourager. This project is an Android application that provides motivational messages by pressing a button. It was developed by my team of four people at the Cal Hacks hackathon. What with the time constraint of 48 hours and low hackathon experience of the team members, much of the effort had gone into coming up with an idea. Once we did, we soon delegated ourselves to which parts of the code we should work on: gathering motivational messages, displaying the messages, transitioning the calming background images, and positioning the messages and images. Encourager is my favorite as I’ve learned how to work with peers that I haven’t coded with before and tackled the Android IDE, which I also haven’t coded in before the hackathon. ","I wish to gain research experience. The majority of my coding projects were accomplished in a classroom setting. Therefore, I’d like to get hands-on experience and apply what I’ve learned in the classroom to the real world if possible. The draw of this program comes from my exposure to data science and research. The former came from Data 8 while the latter from Bioinspired Design. 

The Bioinspired Design course assigned a group research project instead of a final exam. This project required us, divided into teams of five students, to take the accumulation of our class studies and create our own bio-inspired device. My team came up with the CaddisTape, which is an adhesive comprised of caddisworm silk used to join and mend broken bones, ligaments, and so on. This project was only in its beginning stages of developing a device. I hope to participate in a project that goes beyond the first few steps ahead of the starting line. The Discovery Research program would bring all the more sway to the world as the program deals with current issues. Also, this program may help me in finding a niche that I want to work in.","To start off, my teammates and I would share what skills we have. We then define our respective roles as per our skills and delegate ourselves the appropriate parts of the assignment . Moving on, we would start on our assigned tasks, checking in with the others as we progress. The check-ins can be done through a group chat by text messaging or Facebook Messenger. An alternative is the team leader conducting these check-ins, making sure the other members are on track. If one of the team members need help, the team leader can reassign another member to pitch in. As the project is about to be completed, each teammate double checks our own work and revises if necessary. Finally, the team leader looks over the project as a whole.",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"I am interested in this project due to an introductory linguistics class, which I took last semester. For this class, three papers were assigned with the topics of the students’ choices. I chose to write on the differences between human and machine translation for one of my essays. Suppose we focus on the major ones. On one hand, human translation is more accurate and appropriate than machine translation. On the other hand, the latter translation can process greater input amount at a faster rate than the former. Through this project, machine translation may be put on par with human translation in terms of accuracy. This project can be transferred into other areas of study as well, paving the road for further innovation.",Data Visualization for User Experience,"I am interested in this project as it can lead to more efficient research. Once the data visualization techniques can be utilized correctly, researchers can progress in their work through these methods. This would be the quicker alternative to sifting through the text.

Before I made this realization, I waited for meaning to wander into my life. In this fantasy world, I would decide to pursue that thing for the rest of my life, I would love it and my life would have focus. To my surprise, this day never came and I wandered into Cal undeclared, with five potential majors in mind.

I was strong in math, and had passed an intro to computer science course in high school, so I picked data science, the hot new major that attracted students by the thousands. 

I’ve realized that you must commit to something and stick with it. In this case, it was data science. All I can say is that there are easier majors out there. While I started my lower division courses, I also thought more deeply about my interests, which I could potentially apply to a career. 

One such interest was cultivated during a summer of high school when I worked for my cousin at her startup in Mato Grosso, Brazil, a small, municipal town at the forefront of the Amazon Rainforest.  On top of the initial interest I had for conservation, this experience opened my eyes and cultivated a passion for land use. 

One project we worked on was drafting an application for a Rotary Grant that intended to pilot a new conservation and reforestation strategy for water springs and riverbanks. Our intended beneficiaries would be six low income rural landowners that would be brought into compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC). We targeted landowners without the means to reforest, that risked losing their land due to non-compliance fines.

Before going to Brazil, my perception of deforestation was one sided. They should just stop cutting down trees right? After the experience, however, I realized that deforestation is a complex issue with many interacting parts. You can’t simply tell people to cease all deforesting. It is their livelihood and a substantial portion of Brazil’s income.

This experience made me decide to pursue a domain emphasis in Geospatial Information and Technology. It will allow me to combine my technical skills and my passion for land use. 

My passion for land use didn’t fall into my lap nor was it written in the stars. This way is more meaningful though; knowing that I worked for it and sought out an enriching experience makes this path all the more satisfying. I intend to continue to cultivate my passions. In fact, this is how I wish to measure my success.",My interest in Discovery stems from my curiosity in research and wanting to continue to acquaint myself in labs. I think this experience will help me develop research skills within fields I wish to cultivate interests in. ,"I believe an important pillar of teamwork is communication. All team members must first meet to discuss their intended goals and approach to a project. Then, a team leader should delegate tasks based on the unique skills of each team member. Throughout the course of a project, team members should be in regular contact to avoid any miscommunication.  ",Data for Social Good,"I am interested in Data for Social Good, because this project would allow me to use my technical skills while also supporting causes that resonate with me. 
I believe I can offer my skills in GIS to aid in this effort. During my research internship last summer, I worked with machine learning techniques to classify imagery of mangrove forests from Baja California. My team and I gathered field data and flew drones over a set of forest sites to collect UAV imagery. After using Agisoft Metashape to create orthomosaics of each site, I contributed to the effort by using QGIS to classify their pixels as mangrove or non-mangrove. I trained a classifier with OrfeoToolbox, using this classified data of two classes. I tested my classifier on new sites and it performed with accuracies ranging from 80-90%. The purpose of this ongoing project is to quantify the effect of climate change and the impact of illegal deforesters on these forests and to provide this data to ecologists and the Mexican government. I hope to develop my GIS skills, skills I find important to explore in my domain of study; data science with a focus in geospatial information and technology. Thank you for considering my application.",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I resonate with this project because I am a woman in STEM. I live the reality of this role; most of my peers are male and sometimes I am not as comfortable in my classes as I should be. I try my best to overcome the discomfort and have gained a tenacity to learn and hold my own in my technical classes. There exists a sisterhood of women in tech; a sort of unspoken understanding of struggles one another faces. It’s part of my story and part of the reason why I and other women in tech want to change the face of this field. For all of these reasons, I think this experience would be extremely eye-opening and allow me to interact with faculty and other students who also resonate with this space. I believe an experience like this one can give me a great foundation in data visualization; a skill I hope to develop during my academic career. ",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"With a domain emphasis in Geospatial Information & Technology in my studies, I hope to apply my GIS and Python skills within a project that aims to use technology to convey the disadvantages of nonrenewable energy within communities of color.

For instance, my friend and I made a spreadsheet to rank different study spots on and off campus as a means for us to constantly explore new places and to incorporate adventure into our work. 

Additionally, I’m a creative. I’m often doodling in my bullet journal or making and selling button pins - a hobby I picked up in high school. Since then, I’ve recognized that this venture of mine has the potential to create a lot of plastic and material waste, so I love being creative with packaging my products, maybe packaging a bulk pin order in a painted Pringles can. 

My hope is that my hobby of making small trinkets can provide joy and cuteness with as minimal impact on the environment. Sustainability is something I highly care about; I intend on minoring in Sustainable Design because I’m interested in the bigger picture of how our decisions in policy or planning impacts the environment and community. 

","Data 8 was one of my favorite courses last semester. Assigned projects were really fun for me because I liked being able to apply the methods I learned in class towards interesting real-life topics, such as cardiovascular diseases or movie genres. Through participating in Discovery Research, I hope to further my learning in Data Science topics and solidify the skills I’ve learned this past semester. 
","I enjoy working in teams. Seeing how my efforts fit together with everyone else’s is my favorite aspect of teamwork. Because of my organizational skills and how I focus on the bigger picture, I often end up taking a leadership role.

Moreover, flexibility is what I value most when it comes to working with others. As a freelance graphic designer, I get the opportunity to work with people from all over the country on a variety of different projects. Through my various projects, I’ve learned to really accommodate different types of input and ideas while still adding my own expertise and knowledge into projects to create something beyond just myself or my clients.
",Community Air Monitoring Monthly Report,"Every time I step out of the airport in Taiwan, I’ll be hit by a blast of humid, smelly air. The air quality there is horrendous, impacted by the industrial power plants, and worsened by the topography. Having grown up in the Bay Area, I’ve been immensely thankful - the air I breathe feels significantly better than that of my extended family in Taiwan. However, with recent events like the California wildfires, I’ve begun to realize that my assumption that the air I breathe here is safe - a result of visiting places with constant hazardous air quality - is not always true. Moreover, taking the Environmental Science for Sustainable Development course this past semester was very eye-opening; I learned a lot about air pollution, from its impacts to its sources. 

I want to better understand the impacts of the air I breathe. In fact, my final research project in my Environmental class focused on examining indoor air quality; my motivations for this project topic was because most people assumed air quality indoors is healthy due to being told to stay inside during hazardous AQI levels. I want to work on this Community Air Monitoring Monthly Report project because I want to help educate communities on air pollution. 
",Data Enabled Donations,"For the California wildfires, my high school donated a truckload of goods to support relief efforts. I made nifty flyers and infographics to publicize the donation drive my leadership class organized and to indicate which goods were most needed. But articles later came out reporting relief centers being overwhelmed with the “wrong” donations and consequently sending them to landfills. From my experience helping organize a donation drive, I know that the desire to help when disaster strikes is there. But mobilizing the desire into something useful and impactful is surprisingly difficult. It shouldn’t be. 

We’re always being told to be prepared for when disaster strikes us. But we also need to know how to best help others when disaster strikes them. I want to work on the Data-Enabled Donations project to help make the most of human altruism.

Growing up, I was primarily interested in STEM topics, and became involved in math and robotics competitions, as well as materials science research. However, in the past couple of years, I have been increasingly involved in projects at the intersection of STEM and other fields, such as business, design, or social justice. For example, one of my favorite past experiences was developing and teaching a class about HTML and CSS at Ophelia's Place, a safe-space organization for at-risk girls in the Eugene-Springfield area. Through teaching this class, I was able to utilize my passion for my academic interests to inspire younger girls to pursue a field that is male-dominated. Last semester, I participated in the Discovery Research Program in a data-driven online marketing project. Although I had never considered myself a person with much interest in or knowledge about business, I have always thought that the process behind a firm's marketing or financial decisions is fascinating. Learning about subjects like choosing an attribution model for search ad click-through rates was really interesting for me, as I was able to see how data science impacts business decisions.","Through participation in the Discovery Research program, I hope to gain new skills in and awareness about data science through research, as well as make valuable connections with others who are also very enthusiastic about the field. When I have previously participated in research, I've found that the experiences really helped shape my career interests and hone my analysis skills. Additionally, I was able to become close with my mentors and teammates from these projects, and was academically inspired by and thankful for the community that was formed. However, most importantly, I hope that I will be able to work on a project through the Discovery Research program that will make a difference in an issue that I care about, whether it be gender equality, political influence, or cybersecurity.","To me, teamwork is about transparency about work, willingness to consider and support each other's ideas, and open communication. Whether it was a dance group or a leadership team, I have found that these three attributes are crucial to a team's ability to work efficiently and capably. Last year, when I was the secretary of the Deutsch-Slottman Hall Association, we very quickly ran into trouble with members' meeting and event attendance. While this situation was not ideal, we were able to resolve it by having an open conversation to set clear guidelines for each role, as well as coming up with ways to plan ahead and compensate for absences.",Right Wing Sheriffs,"One of the main reasons I decided to apply to the Discovery Research program is that I would like to work on research that is meaningful and has a social impact.

Overall, I wish to first and foremost learn more about data science and how it can be applied to important research and gain the skills that would help me become a data scientist that can make a change one day. ","Communication is the most important element in maintaining good teamwork dynamics to me. While I want to make sure that my thoughts are communicated well to my team, I need to also make sure that everyone had a chance to give their input as well. Constant communication can avoid and minimize mistakes that may arise in a team. If I realize at one point that another group member and I have significant differences that would affect the progress of the team, I would try to resolve the issue privately with them so that we can still work together effectively. Teamwork is to be responsible towards my own tasks while making sure that I am on the right track with everyone else. ",Student Success Analytics Platform,"As a student within the College of Letters and Science myself, I'm very interested in student success. I want to learn what types of data can be used to predict student success and how these different factors can affect students. I’m interested in this project because I want to know how the performance of students in the College of Letters and Science can be improved. I want to be part of this team that can discover the key to student success and contribute to the improvement of the students’ learning environment so that we can strive. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I’m interested in this project because I would like to learn how the process of visualizing data works in a professional setting and specifically how it can be applied to the analyzation of women in STEM. As a woman pursuing a STEM major, the data and objective of this project is significant to me. I also want to learn how the data visualization will be used and what can be done to improve the growth of female professionals in the tech industry.

In my senior year of high school, I worked at a tutoring center for ages K-8 and really enjoyed it. It made me want to pursue teaching or at least a career working to help the education system, even if it isn't something as direct as being a teacher. Education is really important as it can change your life no matter the age. I had a really encouraging 3rd grade teacher that honestly made a pretty big impact on my childhood; she helped make me more interested in learning and also feel more confident as a child. In addition, back in my hometown, I volunteered at my local library where there were computer classes hosted for the elderly people. My hometown has a very large Chinese immigrant population, so most of the people coming to the classes had a language barrier in addition to a technological generation gap. For them, learning how to use basic computer features such as Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, etc. made them genuinely happy. Both technology and education can be empowering for those of all ages, which I hope to be able to contribute to in the future.","I hope to gain more experience through research. I am still considering and trying to declare different majors such as Computer Science, Data Science, or Statistics. To be honest, I do not really know the different career path options for these majors. I know a lot of people talk about how these majors can help you get a tech job, but I hope to learn through participating in research different applications you can do with Data Science and hopefully have the opportunity to get hands-on experience with it.","My approach to teamwork is that communication is key. Although I do not have any experience in working in teams in terms of research, when I worked at the tutoring center, teamwork was a really important aspect of the job. It was important that we communicated with each other in order to do things more efficiently; different tutors knew some kids better than others, so we helped each other a lot in terms of what specific kids needed help on and how to communicate with their parents. If problems came up, it was always easier to let everyone know so we could work together to come up with a solution. When working in teams, I tend to be easygoing and communicative to my teammates.",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"Ever since I worked at a tutoring center, I started becoming more interested in finding a career path involving education. I want to explore different ways to positively help the education system other than teaching. At the tutoring center, there were also achievement gaps between students despite the fact that most of the students went to similar if not the same schools in neighboring districts. While everybody has a different learning pace, some of the students there were really behind despite being bright kids. At the tutoring center, we noticed that a lot of the kids with unstable family situations back home tended to be struggling more academically than the ones with supportive parents at home who were genuinely invested in their kid's academic progress. It was actually quite heartbreaking to notice this; I am really interested in this project because I want to understand more about the achievement gaps in the Berkeley public schools and the data behind it. I hope by bringing more awareness to issues like these, more resources will be given to public schools to help students who are struggling more.",Computational Analysis of Charter School Identities and Stratification,"Ever since I worked at a tutoring center, I started becoming more interested in finding a career path involving education. I want to explore different ways that positively help the education system other than teaching. At the tutoring center I worked at, there was not as much diversity in terms of race, but there were students with different backgrounds in terms of family economic status and family stability which did contributed to how they performed academically. I think it is important for students to have an equal footing regardless of race and economic status, even though that is not always the case. I am interested in understanding more about the segregation that exists in our education system, and hopefully understanding the data regarding this issue will be the first step in addressing and solving it.

My parents immigrated from China as political refugees in search of economic opportunities. We relied on a single family income, and resources were limited. I knew pursuing higher education would change my current situation and provide my family with new opportunities. As such, I utilized outside resources that my school had to offer in order to pursue my dream of becoming a data scientist.

I recently completed an internship with NASA, where I had the opportunity to work with the Business Intelligence and Data Science Teams, using Tableau to clean and analyze datasets in order to create powerful visualizations that yield strong, reliable insights. I analyzed key performance metrics for NASA’s NLP tagging application using machine learning, enabling better data-driven decision making while improving the overall efficiency and understanding of the agency’s data usage. 

This was an eye opening experience for me, as I was able to challenge myself and apply what I learned from my academics in a real world setting. I learned a tremendous amount in a short period of time, and am beyond motivated to further expand my analytical and technical skills in projects and research. 
","What I wish to gain in participating in Discovery Research is to be able to immerse myself in a challenging community that will allow me to learn, develop, and contribute my skills academically and professionally through cutting-edge data research projects. I wish to utilize the support from graduate and postdoctoral students, community impact groups, entrepreneurial ventures, and educational initiatives across UC Berkeley in order to gain insight and knowledge that goes beyond the classroom. Ultimately, I want to be part of a community where my work is valued and will have a positive impact on others, and I am confident that an opportunity in Discovery Research will allow me to do so. 
","My approach to effective teamwork incorporates both collaboration, communication, and commitment. As a volunteer tutor for Google Code Corps, I actively encourage students to discuss ideas and to work together. Collaboration is crucial because it provides an opportunity to exchange ideas with one another to find creative solutions while incorporating diverse perspectives.

Moreover, communication is vital to the success working in a team. During my time as the Student Chief Systems Engineer for the NASA Aerospace Scholars Program, there was an evening when my team needed to work on a rover design past midnight in order to meet a deadline. Although none of us were required to stay, I discussed with my teammates that it was important to stay a bit later in order to finish the project, since the deadline was approaching. My teammates agreed. I believe the success of the group is just as important as the success of the individual, since the only thing better than succeeding on your own is succeeding as a team. 
",Data Visualization for User Experience,"I am interested in the Data Visualization for User Experience Startup Projects because I want to further develop and expand on my data visualization techniques and natural language processing skills. 

At my most recent internship at NASA Headquarters, I was able to utilize several libraries such as spaCy and NLTK to analyze performance metrics for NASA’s NLP application. I also had the opportunity to visualize my insights and findings using Tableau, presenting it to my team during the weekly meetings. 

I believe my skills and experiences bring value to this project, and will allow me to contribute what I have learned from my academics and experiences to obtain valuable insights.
",Dispatcher algorithm,"I am interested in the Kiwi Campus Dispatcher Algorithm project because I want to improve and optimize the assignation of orders through the Kiwibot. On multiple occasions, I have used Kiwibot services, only to get lost in navigation and attempting to locate what I have ordered. As such, I believe I will be able to make significant contributions to help improve the robot assignation for orders received through the Kiwi Campus marketplace.

I am a firm believer in utilizing data to make effective decisions. Through the Kiwibot Dispatcher Algorithm project, I will be able to apply what I have learned from my academics and experiences to make the service more effective and efficient.
",NASA data viz,"I am interested in the NASA Data Visualization project through NASA Ames Research Center because I want to further develop and hone my skills through data visualization and programming in Python.

I also had the opportunity to visualize my insights and findings using Tableau, presenting it to my team during the weekly meetings. One of my favorite parts about my internship with NASA was the impact I was able to have as an intern, and I know that my experiences, skillset, and contributions will be of value to the NASA Data Visualization Project as well.

I also have a strong academic background in Python, having taken and excelled in multiple class such as Object-Oriented Programming methodologies in Python, Data Structures and Algorithms, the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, and several other Python classes through online academic platforms.

In terms of my academic interests, they change often which is why it was a struggle for me to decide what I wanted to major in. At times I wanted to study economics, at others computer science, and I’m really happy that I’ve been able to explore those pathways as well. However, my passion really is in biology, especially the research side. I’ve had the privilege of working in four different biology research labs. In the first lab, my project was looking at biomarkers for a rare disease called cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD) that leads to demyelination in the brain. The second was a plant genetics lab where I looked at the effect of certain genes on the phenotype of plants. The third was looking at bystander uptake of different cell lines in amino acid mediums, and the fourth lab is looking at gene therapy regarding retinal degeneration. The labs have been very different from the techniques I have learned, to the projects I have worked on- but I’m very thankful for all of it. 
","By participating in Discovery Research, I hope to gain insight into how data science can be applied in the real world. From doing biology research in the past, it became clear that learning about the science and process of a lab technique is very different than applying it and actually performing it. During research, what I learned in the classroom becomes alive- it reveals why what I learned in class is important, and how it can be used to solve problems. By participating in Discovery Research, I hope to learn the same about data science. While applying what I learned in class, it would be a privilege to learn even more about the field of data science. ","I love the idea of working on a team, and that’s one of the reasons I wanted to be a business major until I realized there are team-oriented opportunities in any field I choose. In previous computer science classes, I always worked with other people to brainstorm before beginning to write any lines of code. We would discuss which data structures would be appropriate, design ideas, possible test cases, and bounced ideas off of one another. It was during these times that the daunting task of a project became more realistic. I’ve also learned the importance of teamwork by seeing the principal investigators of the research labs I’ve worked in collaborate with other experts in their field. The principal investigators I’ve worked with are very knowledgable in their areas of biology, but still they discuss with others to gain even more insight. Being able to see this collaboration first hand is one of the reasons I’m considering going into research, so that I can always continue learning and working with others. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"My major is Microbial Biology, so right off the bat I was intrigued by this project because I love learning about biology and medicine. During my job as a medical scribe, I’e heard the physician or cardiologist order an echocardiogram to determine if a new blood pressure medication is effective, or a an echocardiogram to determine the cause of chest pain. What interests me about this project is how this data can be used to actually detect and prevent cardiovascular disease. My sophomore year at Berkeley is when I took my first data science and computer science courses, and it’s fascinating to see how biology can be combined with data science to actually save lives. During my research internship this past summer, the building I worked in was called the Cancer and Cardiovascular Research Building, and I was placed with a professor that explored cancer treatment- specifically the uptake of chemotherapeutic agents. I really enjoyed and am thankful for everything I learned there, but cardiovascular research is also intriguing especially given the number of lives it claims. I’m interested in this project because it combines two of the things I’m passionate about- medicine and data science. 
",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"My major is Microbial Biology, so right off the bat I was intrigued by this project because I love learning about biology and medicine. Not only that, but it combines medicine with data science. This past summer, I had the opportunity to work in a research lab that explored the uptake of chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment. This type of research involved culturing different cell lines, following protocols, measuring fluorescence with microscopes, and other molecular biology techniques. On the other hand, the Pathologists Cancer Alert project uses natural language processing and data science techniques. Both projects are aimed at fighting cancer and saving lives, and I’m very interested to see another side of cancer research outside of a biology lab. My sophomore year at Berkeley is when I took my first data science and computer science courses, and I loved how it was a different way of thinking compared to how I approached my biology or chemistry courses. I’m interested in this project because it combines two of the things I’m passionate about- medicine and data science.

When my grandma went back to India, she left me with a huge responsibility: taking care of the garden. However, I got so caught up in my first-grade homework (coloring took me a long time), that I abandoned the garden.
     As years passed by, I was able to reinvigorate my passion for nature and sustainability through joining Local Leaders of the 21st Century, volunteering for Chabot Space and Science Center’s enviro team, and interning at the Go Green Initiative. I helped create succulent gardens and took field trips to local composting facilities and landfills to delve deeper into the field. I became driven to enact change and implemented a tri-bin waste system, adding recycling and composting bins, to all 16 schools in the district. 
     Being immersed in environmental science concepts and learning about conservation has pushed me to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. I make a conscious effort to reduce consumption when I’m shopping, bring my reusable cutlery and water bottle wherever I go and became vegan to limit my negative impact on the environment. 
","     I hope to expand my technical skills and pursue my passion for environmental sustainability through the Data Science Discovery Research Program. Working with fellow peers will allow me to build a strong community and being mentored by industry professionals and professors will give me the opportunity to explore the vast field of data science. 
     I’m extremely interested in the Environmental Justice Mapping Project (Goldman School of Public Policy) as it allows me to apply the skills I’ve learned from both of my majors. As part of the Students of Color Environmental Collective, I’ve learned how minorities and underprivileged people disproportionately face the negative consequences of climate change and seek to raise conversation about environmental racism on and off-campus. Through this mapping project, I hope to help create a current baseline map for the environmental injustices across the country in an online, interactive platform and seek to remedy them in the future. 
     There are several other projects that I’m interested in that also explore the divergence of environmental sustainability and data science including: Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education (ESPM), Identifying Electricity Usage & Disconnection Patterns in Disadvantaged Communities (East Bay Community Energy), and Environmental Health Estimator (SimpleWater Inc).","      While interning with the Go Green Initiative last summer, my perceptions of teamwork were dramatically transformed. We were a month in our project and completely stuck, circling around the same ideas. After talking to our mentor, we restarted, setting aside our month’s of work. We brainstormed from the beginning, outlining a clear set of steps focusing on the long-term objective, rather than individual short-term goals. We slowly weaved our past work into the new framework and although it took a while, we created a solid foundation, ensuring our team’s success. 
      The intern group was very diverse, with each intern bringing new perspectives to the table, which although beneficial, also led to conflicting ideas constantly being presented. However, instead of focusing on the disagreements, we focused on how these ideas could fit together. By the end of the project, our team was a machine of efficiency. With every new problem that arose, from, software malfunctions to email wording, we knew which group member to ask for help. Knowing that communication is key, I hosted morning meetings to focus on collaboration and make sure all group members were aware of the team’s progress and facilitated compromises between members. 
",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"I’m extremely interested in the Environmental Justice Mapping Project (Goldman School of Public Policy) as it allows me to apply the skills I’ve learned from both of my majors. As part of the Students of Color Environmental Collective, I’ve learned how minorities and underprivileged people disproportionately face the negative consequences of climate change and seek to raise the conversation about environmental racism on and off-campus. I’m also interested in public policy, particularly after taking Professors Alastair Iles’s class ESPM 60 to ensure broad-scale public welfare.  This research project also aligns with my experience in Python and my interest in web development and data analysis. Through this mapping project, I hope to help create a current baseline map for the environmental injustices across the country in an online, interactive platform and seek to remedy them in the future. 
",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"I’m interested in the agricultural education project as it allows me to apply skills and gain knowledge from both of my intended majors. As part of the Students of Color Environmental Collective, I’ve learned how minorities and underprivileged people disproportionately face the negative consequences of climate change and seek to raise the conversation about environmental racism on and off-campus. This ties in with the project’s focus on agriculture and social justice and I’m eager to see how it ties in with higher education systems. The research project also aligns with my past experience coding in python and my interest to expand upon my technical skills, while also learning the practical applications.  Through this research project, I hope to analyze the effectiveness of agricultural teachings of education institutions across the country to promote social justice.
",D3 Data Viz using climate finance data,"I’m interested in the climate finance project as it allows me to apply skills and gain knowledge from both of my intended majors. As part of the Data Science Society general member program, I analyzed carbon footprint data from the World Bank to explore the relationship between economic success and environmental consciousness. We concluded that a country’s carbon emissions amount is not reflective of their economic level, measured in GDP per capita, and thus even developing countries are taking great strides to combat climate change. I’m eager to learn more about the global efforts to combat climate change through this research project analyzing climate finance data. Through this research project, I hope to help make online interactive tools about global climate finance information in an accessible way and promote vast sustainability efforts across the globe.

The sound of spinning wheels amplifies. Sitting on the balcony of our farmhouse, my copy of “A Brief History of Time” sprawling across my lap, illuminated by an overhanging bulb and the beautiful “Diyaal” sunset. As I begin to turn the page, the bulb flickers, and goes off, plunging this utopia into darkness.

Diyaal offers a stunning contrast with the sprawling metropolises that surround it, the bright lights juxtaposing the shadows that surround it. Although, I spent most of my life in urban Lahore, Pakistan my heart resides in the dimly lit alleys of my ancestral village, Diyaal.

Diyaal, although harboring extreme potential faces the problem of a lack of resources and illiteracy, the former being more evident. The fields and wheels come to haunt me in my urban life. They beckon me to return and make a change. The yearning to provide opportunities to people living in places like Diyaal is what drives me to pursue STEM. This is what has motivated me to pursue research throughout high-school and furthered my academic interests. Today, the applications of data science coupled with machine learning, for me, hold the key for uplifting the lives of my people and millions around the world living in darkness. ","Through the immense opportunity it offers, the Discovery Research program will allow me to further explore the field of Data Science-one that I’ve recently been acquainted with but interests me deeply. The opportunity to apply the principles of Data Science on real life data sets and projects appeals to me greatly and will allow me to further develop my skills of research and collaboration, that I have employed extensively throughout high school. I will also be able to build on techniques that I have learned through Data 8 and UGBA 88 during my first semester at Berkeley. 

For me, research is an activity that I relish. I see it as a way to positively impact the lives of those around me. Working on projects for some of the game changers in the industry or contributing hands-on to community non-profit impact programs would greatly aid my professional development and set me up well for my future goals of developing projects and programs to ease lives of people globally, in both developed areas and underdeveloped areas such as my own village Diyaal, mentioned above. 

As someone looking forward to academically pursue both applied mathematics and data science, while building upon my interests in economics and social causes, an intrinsically interdisciplinary program such as Discovery Research would allow me to effectively tie together my diverse interests and skills while building on them further. ","Camaraderie, responsibility, empathy: characteristics that differentiate between a group and a team, laying the foundation for success in any field, ranging from sports to academia. These characteristics are cardinal to creating an environment of tolerance, mutual respect and trust. Being empathetic towards each other, understanding others’ problems and limitations and helping them overcome such obstacles are what lead a team to achieve success and its eventual goal.

The quality to lead is therefore essential for every individual, not just by controlling the team at the forefront but by leading one’s own self through the ups and downs and thus achieving the set target. It is imperative for every individual on the team to be committed and responsible so that they can work to the best of their abilities and collaborate with others to solve the problem at hand. Acceptance and tolerance for a difference of opinions and the ability to put aside one’s own ego for the greater good forms the basis of a successful team.

As I progressed from a meek high-school freshman to a confident senior with the ability to organize not just my team but also my thoughts, I began to understand the importance of all the principles and characteristics applied above. Having participated in team-based STEM Olympiads, research projects alongside holding leadership positions, I have experienced the benefits of teamwork firsthand.",NASA data viz,"I was first acquainted with the work of the AMES Research Center when I took part in the NASA AMES Space Settlement Design Competition as a high school sophomore. Further research about AMES led me to understand the center’s work in two fields in particular: air traffic management and high-fidelity flight simulation, tasks which use data tables to track aviational activity. This specific project, NASA Data Visualization, combines my passion for aerospace and aviation with my deep-rooted interest in coding and data analysis. Being proficient in python programming, I have the ability to fulfill the purpose of this project by contributing to its development in Python. Alongside my experience in related fields, it is my passion for the skies and the cosmos above that attracts me towards this project. While other programs, similar to NASA Data Visualization, combine programming and data analysis, this particular project integrates aviation into these skill-sets, creating the perfect blend. I hope to be able to expand on my interests in data visualisation and analysis, while pursuing both my academic and co-curricular interests. Through experience and passion as well as a yearning to learn, I find myself to be suitable for this project. ",Assessing Research Usability for Development Practitioners in Southern Africa,"Researching the conditions in Southern Africa, the lack of awareness and access to everyday information made me realise just how similar its state is to my own ancestral village, Diyaal. Located in rural Punjab, Pakistan, my village is often blanketed by darkness, its lack of electricity and other necessities offering a stark contrast to Lahore, the metropolis that neighbours it. Such disparities put places like Southern Africa and Diyaal even further behind in terms of development. The lapse in communication, awareness and resources aggravating the pre-existing crises- climatic and beyond. Without suitable infrastructure and awareness, the state in such places is destined to worsen. Empathy and relatability engulf me as I understand the purpose of this project, attracting me to take part in it. Due to my emotional association with similar causes and my experience with research and data collection, I deem myself to be suitable for this project. Throughout highschool, I took part in numerous research projects, including one on Diabetes and HbA1c making me well acquainted with data collection and analytical techniques. Furthermore, my proficiency in python and background in data analytics will allow me to make a difference, providing access to research in obscure regions, cut off from the rest of the world.",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"In my opinion, concepts learned in class are useless unless applied to the real world. This project interests me deeply due to the fact that it applies theoretical, class-room knowledge to the real world, using real world data sets to explore disparities that prevail around us in society, particularly in the sphere of education. Through the Student Success Analytics Platform, I will be provided with the opportunity to apply and build upon analysis and classifier techniques that I learned in the class Data 8 during my first semester at Berkeley. What further attracts me towards this project is the fact that the collected and analysed data will in fact benefit the society in the future as it highlights disparities and inequalities present in high schools. Through my experience and interest in data analytics and data processing, I will be able to actively contribute to this project. Furthermore, the project will bolster my professional skills in the areas of data science and machine learning providing me a foundation for the  development of further algorithms on a larger scale.

In my spare time, I would follow the latest tech news and conferences, maybe purchasing one of the cutting edge products. However, those are not all of my life. I like watching all kinds of movies and reading novels in my spare time. In those works, I feel like my life is extended to different worlds. “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” is my favorite science fiction novel. I loved how the question “what defines a human being” is discussed in the novel - androids look like human, speak like human, they even are more superior than human in some aspects. Does that mean that they can be viewed as human beings or even a new race that is superior to us human beings? What’s exactly the boundary between human beings and intelligent machines? Maybe that’s the question we need to consider along with the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning in this era – to think back to the technology itself. It can bring us the improvement of living standards, but it can also bring us society disputes or even war. ","Many people still picture data science or computer science as a geek sitting in front of a computer all day. But that’s not the reason I decided to study computer science and pursue that career for the rest of my life. My private life does not consist entirely of data and code, and I have always been looking for a way to connect engineering subjects to other subjects that seems to have no connection like psychology, sociology and environmental science. Besides, I haven’t participated in college-level researches, and I am curious to see what’s actual research looks like, including basic processes, reports, etc. I believe that I have gained enough background knowledge during the past one and a half years of college life for me to participate in some of the entry-level researches, and I’m looking forward to finally having a chance to apply the theoretical knowledge I have learned in the past to some real-world circumstances.","I used to be part of the engineering team of our high school’s robotics club. We participated in the annual FRC competition. Because building a robot from scratch is such a large and sophisticated project which included various stages like prototyping, modeling and testing, programming, the club was divided into three teams in which everyone can just focus on one side of the robot. This is where teamwork comes in. Although one may know almost nothing about programming, and the other didn’t do well in mechanics, through communication and collaboration, a robot that can perform various amazing jobs is built. 
We had weekly club meetings and biweekly team meetings, in which we report our current process and decide what’s the next step. Those meetings were really important to ensure that the project is on the right track. It is important that everyone knows what other team members are doing. Questions like “is this idea reasonable or achievable?” are especially important when different team members work in different fields. Communication inside a team can be in many forms, meetings, reports, or even daily chats. With adequate team management and communication between team members, teamwork multiplies individual outputs rather than simply adding them together. ",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"Nowadays, the price that one has to pay for joining the disputes online is absurdly low, and that’s why there is so much internet violence. Personally, the existence of hate speech has become the major reason why I rarely play online multiplayer games with people other than my friends. However, the explosion of the Internet provides enormous new possibilities for our society and for us individuals to develop. 
I had an idea of developing a chatbot for elderly people living alone at home in high school. My friend and I had a plan to build a library that records the logical connections between each word so that every time the chatbot wants to make a response, it searches for that word is heard and the words that it connects to in the library. The words also have some other attributes like emotional status because we wanted the chatbot also able to give words of comfort based on the user's emotions. However, due to both time and technology constraints, the plan didn’t work out. To some extent, I feel that this plan of ours is related to this project, and I want to contribute my share to shift the internet into a more friendly, inclusive space where one can see ideas from all over the globe collide, mix, and give birth to a greater one. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"When I was taking Data8, I was amazed by how data can be visualized. I think data visualization enables a more intuitive and understandable way of interpreting the data. Originally the data may seem like nonsense when they are all crowded in a single spreadsheet, but after performing a series of analyzing and visualization, anyone can read that data and at least have some basic level of understanding of that huge amount of data. That’s also where data science fascinates me. 
What’s more, as a woman in engineering, I personally have felt that women are still an underrepresented group in fields of engineering. There have been a few times when I go to discussions, I am the only woman in the classroom. However, those are still my own perceptions, and I am interested in the actual analyzed results using the various scientific tools from the dataset. I am excited to gain some hands-on experience using the skills I learned from lectures. ",Community Air Monitoring Monthly Report,"Oxygen is the key to our lives. So is air quality. I have seen the sky became vague, sunlight couldn’t reach the ground because the small factories didn’t follow the environmental emission standards back in 2012 in my hometown. The air was filled with pollutants. People had to stay inside or wear special masks to go out. After that, I realized the importance of controlling emission and started to pay attention to those air quality reports. 
It is important to have those monthly reports or even daily ones to monitor the amount of pollutants emitted and to inform the residents in that area so that they can make preparations to cope with any possible situations. The sensors used to monitor air quality provide a large amount of data, but most of them require professional knowledge to understand. This is where data scientist comes in – rather than writing long and professional papers, we should interpret the data into more intuitive results that everyone can understand. I am willing to apply my knowledge to complete this job and to contribute to the community.  ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,From my friends. ,No,1,

It was a cloud-based mobile application that converts handwritten medical records into actionable data sets so governments and health institutions can take a data-driven approach towards improving public healthcare. I love to work on projects that have a positive social impact and I feel that data science will be the leading research field that would help solve the number of problems our society faces today.,"Through the Data Discovery program, I intend to learn how data science can be used to accelerate the advancement of various fields of studies.

My family had deeply believed that my “destiny” was to become a writer in China until a mind-blowing trip to the U.S. when I was15. Soon I decided to come to the U.S. to experience a free and diverse culture. After getting into Berkeley, I intended to major in economics, but accidentally took Data 8 and fell in love with the subject. This started my journey exploring and transforming into a female engineer and leader: had absolutely no coding experience, I challenged myself to declare CS major and pursuing a data science minor; apart from that, I “unlocked” my potential and interest in design and entrepreneurship, taking various classes to expand my horizon; thanks to my passion for promoting Chinese culture, I was able to unite the 3000+ Chinese students on campus as the president of BCSSA and organized events introducing our culture to the world; we have helped thousands of Chinese students with every aspect of fitting in and enjoying U.S. college life, as well as further career development.

I wish to gain hands-on experience on the research process, and sharpen my critical and analytical thinking and scientific reasoning skills, as well as to meet new people and learn from each other. More importantly, what’s special about the Discovery Program is that it fully explores Data Science’s interdisciplinary nature, and provides me with the opportunity to utilized what I’ve learned in class as a tool to solve critical problems and reach informational conclusions in another field that I’m interested in. Hopefully through out this journey, I will be able to prepare myself even a little more for advanced studies in Data Science and graduate school, and find a project or a field to continuously contribute to. From the first two years of college I have learned that there’s nothing too difficult to learn, and there’s nothing too hard to try, so I am always eager to learn more and contribute more.","I can’t think of a better analogy but “water-like” to describe my approach to teamwork. In the Chinese philosopher Laozi’s theory, the highest good is like that of water, as water is something that softens, lubricates, and mollifies, softly and unconsciously. That’s me in teams, trying to glue everyone together with care and humor and thus promoting working efficiency. Always being kind to people, I look to coordinate interpersonal relationships and seek and give help when needed. Moreover, water benefits everything without evoking resistance, and promotes harmony while staying unique. Similarly, when facing conflicts, different from the saying “agree to disagree”, I tend to focus on finding a harmonious overall situation that everyone is satisfied with.  However, when bearing reasonably different opinions with others or having new inspirations, I would express my ideas openly without hesitation. Having been serving as the Project Manager role often in past experiences, I’m good at specify long and short term goals and dividing up work to make sure everyone’s strength is utilized and maximized. I’m also a good and creative task performer who follow close to restrictions while present new thoughts.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"Driving on the highway around California, it’s really hard to NOT notice the huge billboards with “Weed is Legal in 60 Miles” on it. Out of curiosity, I did a little research on the ad owner “WeedMaps”, on whose website I saw many complicated classifications and variations of cannabis products. Indeed, as more and more states are legalizing medical and recreational use of cannabis, the growing market of cannabis is worth studying, just like any other market: wine market, medicine market, etc. And I’m extremely interested in analyzing trends in this market as it can be greatly influenced by governmental policies and the general public and society, and these topics happen to be what I am interested in further studying on. This project not only matches my interest but also my skillset in CS and Data Science. I feel confident writing python code and had experience cleaning raw data, and I am familiar with the full cycle and stages of data analysis process. I’ve done projects in the field of AI and had necessary knowledge for supervised and unsupervised ML and Reinforcement Learning.

Not the insect but… I heard scholars use this technique to gather articles with certain keywords and get a summary… can you write one for me?” She must be talking about web scraping techniques, that I could try, but if she wants the summary, that would be way more difficult to realize as it involves training models and classify articles…definitely not something I could finish alone. Then I saw this project in the discovery program page, describing the exact thing she wanted. What a coincidence! Obviously, such a tool is greatly demanded by people ranging from researchers to teachers in high school, and I would love to contribute to building it to greatly save people’s time. Moreover, this project matches with my background as I am familiar with the full cycle of data analysis process as well as the field of AI on topics such as supervised and unsupervised ML and Reinforcement Learning. More importantly, I am a quick learner, and I’m more than happy to learn any skills that’s required for this project. :)",Innovation Resources Database,"I’m interested in this project because I know what is feels like without it. As a woman interested in creative design and starting up my own business, I have been pursuing the certificates for Design Innovation and Entrepreneurship and Technology at Berkeley, thus I have always wanted such a “one-stop” platform where I can collect information about potential opportunities to gain more experiences in the field of innovation and technology. On the other side, being the president of the biggest Chinese student organization on campus, I often receive emails asking me to forward info about some innovative events or internship opportunities to the students, but our platform covers mostly Chinese students and is impossible to spread these news to the whole campus. The creation of this database would turn this into a win-win situation. This project also matches with my background as I feel comfortable writing python or java code and basic knowledge of database systems through internship. I am also familiar with the full cycle of data analysis process as well as supervised/unsupervised ML and Reinforcement Learning. More importantly, I am a quick learner, and I’m more than happy to learn any skills that’s required for this project. :)",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,N/A,None,Email,N/A,1,

I have taken classes in digital mapping and linear modeling, and serve as a TA for the foundational data science course at Cal. My favorite class outside my major was Fungi, History, and Society. It was amazing to learn how intricately fungi interact with plants and animals. I also love learning about Bay Area history. I grew up in Berkeley so the places and stories feel very real to me. ",I hope to gain experience using data to form insights so that I can better interpret studies and conduct research.

This can be explained by my general curiosity in everything. Academically, I have developed my curiosity in various areas of study. Other than my declared majors of Applied Mathematics and Data Science, I am also interested in Economics by opting it as my domain emphasis for both majors. Since my first Economics class in high school freshman year, I have developed my interests in that by reading news and articles at times. Taking Econ classes that are Math or Data Analytics related in college, I believe I am approaching it in a more quantitative and practical perspective. Numbers involved allow me to understand the models with numerical examples so that the impacts of certain moves or policies in each case would be more accurate and comprehensible to me.  As an intern in a Financial Leasing Corporate last summer, I researched and drafted a report about Chinese Textile Industry in terms of its segments and history and what types of companies in this industry should the corporate lease to. This research experience taught me how to ask questions and evaluate the resources online. It also initiates my interests in continuing doing research. ","By participating in Discovery Research, I wish to gain some hands-on experience of dealing with large databases. It is expected that more complicated situations would be encountered in both data cleaning and visualization phases of a data science research. In addition to identify and remove the unwanted data, I look forward to learning how to trace the root cause of these anomalies and what is a better approach for it compared to straightly discard it. Moreover, getting involved in Discovery Research allows me to practice my coding skills and data science techniques outside of class. I would like to gain more empirical experiences in using Python, R or SQL languages in their most fitted cases and contrasting their usages in different stages of exploration, visualization or interpretation. Also, it would be a great opportunity for me to learn from some professional researchers in designing and organizing a data science research. ","Communication is the key in making teamwork. It is my first approach. When it comes to communication, there are several aspects to look at.  Most importantly, I would share my thoughts and respond to messages in time. Besides, I would listen to others actively. These two collaboratively make the communication, which means the exchange of information between both parties. Great communication makes every member in the team to get informed and updated in time. This transparency among the team members adds to the efficiency of the teamwork. Moreover, my second approach is to help and support other members after finishing my jobs. This ensures everyone of us to finish our parts in time so that the team as a whole could move forward. This is another key to teamwork as everyone is supportive and responsible. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"Cannabis has always been controversial across the US. People hold different opinions on it and distinct state governments have variable regulations. It is interesting to me to research various political and cultural elements influencing this market by applying my knowledge in micro-economics, especially from Econ 100A. This would be helpful in identify and transform the unstructured data sets. In addition, natural language processing is relatively new to me. Since I am a quick learner, I believe this would be a great opportunity for me to quickly get my hands on it and practice it straight away. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"Personally as a woman in tech and both my majors defined as STEM, I am curious about the performance of women in this field. Since it is still vague in the description that what we are going to study is the participation of women in this field, it seems I am capable of raising specific questions about this research like how women are treated in certain situation and if women are differently performed in this field to men, etc. This is one of the most enjoyable process in a research project to me. Also, since the project focus on data visualization, it allows me to experiment with tremendous graphs. This is a valuable opportunity because the varieties among these plots would be likely to be perceptible with this large database.  ",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"After taking ESPM 155AC, food injustice has came to be one of my concerns about the status quo of US society. Even though the class realized that education has a great impacts on these inequalities that are actively witnessed in US society, this project raise a more specific question about the amelioration brought by the pedagogical practices. The great learning experience of that class ignites my interests in this project. I am willing to continuing studying this structural inequalities and its relationship to Agriculture education in some higher Education Institutions. Also, since this project is defined as “team-oriented” and “learning-by-doing,” I believe I would practice more of my teamwork skills and learn more about the food and agricultural education in these schools and their impacts.

I have always had an avid interest in technology since I was a kid - may it be drawing on MS logo, using Photoshop, writing in HTML and CSS or even today programming in Java and Python. Upon completion of three semesters here at Berkeley, I realized that my true interest lies at the analytical aspect of technology - its implications on the world around us, and how it shapes our actions. Besides this, I have always been an avid photographer - scenic photographs being my favorite kinds of snapshots. Even though I believe the eyes are the best camera a human can ever have, there is a certain beauty in capturing what is infront you - it's like stopping time - which is perhaps one of the few impossible things in our world, but a camera can make it merely possible. ","I recently discovered my true interest and passion for technology analytics and would like to gain some true hands-on experience in the field to expand my knowledge-base and skills in the field. The Discovery Research Program has some very interesting projects that I have faintly worked on a bit in the past, and I would like to take a newer approach using a newer method of learning under the guidance and mentorship of accomplished and experiences indivituals. ","My true approach to teamwork can be described through Versara - a project that was undertaken by four of us, all female undergraduates, as a part of STEP - Berkeley Entrepreneurial Association's startup pitching competition. We started from scratch. We would set weekly goals of research and slowly worked on the project. We would discuss the pros and cons of everything we came up with - and once we finally decided on Versara, worked together to come up with a working MVP in ten weeks. We would divide work based on skill, but at the same time work in the same space so that everyone was aware of all the work everybody was doing and that everybody was getting constant feedback. I was in charge of building the front end of the website and developing a potential business model, and I found that I could think and work better when there was a room of people who had different viewpoints which I could consider. The process of working becomes more interactive and intuitive, and furthermore, more educational. Hence, I believe that true success and satisfaction can be achieved when there are multiple minds instead of one, because at the end of the day, what really is success if it cannot be shared ? ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,I carried out a research project last spring which analyzed  streaming business models and how they affect all the people associated with it. There I discovered a concept called digital free economics as the root cause to the success of streaming models and would like to work not his project as to understand how streaming data can be predicted and analysed such as to come up with more efficient business models and applications. This seems like a continuation of research that I already have a little background about and hence would love to work on it ! ,Data visualization of state of women in tech,"As a woman of color myself, I have always been passionate about promoting women in fields of technology and business. In high school I carried out a survey based project with my classmate called GirlSTEM where I analysed and collected data on the number of female students that drop out of STEM fields in high school, and the reasons that lead them to make this choice. I would hence like to learn more about this problem through this project, and once day perhaps use my skills and knowledge to come up with a true solution to the problem and promote more women in tech fields! ",Kiwibot delivery robots,"Believe it or not, Kiwi bots were the first things that could my attention when I first came to Berkeley. Coming from a large busy city like New Delhi, I found the concept of electronic robotic delivery of food very intriguing indeed and a splendid use of technology to make common day-to-day events more efficient. (Also adding to the debate, ""Will Robots take over the world?"", well they're already making it to the food industry too). Hence, I would like to work on the project that estimates a satisfactory delivery time for clients, since the use of technology to produce more efficiency has always been something that has interested me, and hence am interested in working with the KiwiBots company.

At Cal, I was part of a social enterprise, focusing on the empowerment of entrepreneurs through our proceeds that came from ethically sourced clothing. Wanting to have the ability to apply what I learned in my classes in a more technical fashion, I joined a pro-bono consulting organization focusing on helping Bay-Area non-profits. I loved being a part of these organizations because I could find an intersection of my technical skills as well as satisfying personal interests of mine to contribute to society. Another experience outside of data science is my love for teaching. When I was in high school, I founded my own tutoring business, tutoring kids in my neighborhood or ones at school. At Cal, I was able to work at a high school that works with low-income, high-achieving students. The thing I loved about both of these experiences was seeing how I was making a direct impact and seeing results immediately, showing that something I did actually can impact someone’s life.","Through Discover Research, I hope to be able to gain the opportunity to have experiences where I can apply and see how data science is applicable to real-world settings. In the past, I have had more marketing and analytics work experience, and while I eventually would like to end up in the marketing industry, I believe that developing my technical skills in a directly applicable situation is how I can become well versed in this industry. I also hope to meet professionals in this industry who can offer me mentorship experiences. What better way to learn than from those who’s day-to-days are exactly what I want to do in the future. I would like to meet people who have the same interests as me and have been able to make a living pursuing their passions. No matter how much education you may receive, it’s only put to good use if you can see what you’re doing and learn from its applicability. ","Teamwork is only possible through transparency and communication. Having been both a leader and a follower, I know when it is time for me to speak up and take initiative or when it is time for me to listen to others and be more of a facilitator. As an ESFJ, my approach to teamwork lies in my ability to empathize with my teammates, incentivizing those around me to work for each other and to want to be better for each other. Currently, I am the Vice President of Marketing in my fraternity and one of my main responsibilities is this upcoming spring recruitment. However, the only time frame to work has been over winter break, and my team is spread all over the world, in multiple time zones. To ensure that work was being done efficiently, yet without micromanaging, I worked around my team’s schedule, scheduling calls when it was more convenient for them. Showing that I was willing to be flexible to their availabilities inspired them to get work done and not feel burdened at having to work over break. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"Coming from a STEM-focused high school, this hits directly home for me. My high school had a 3:1 boy to girl ratio and myself as a woman in a STEM field, I want this information to be public that the world is changing. Coming to Berkeley, with a wider range of resources, I am surprised to see the lack of women in STEM as this was a primary reason that my high school was so lacking. I believe that in making this information public, it will inspire those to know that they are not alone in this industry.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"I believe that this project, with its potential to learn new software and have the ability to work with machine learning is a wonderful opportunity. As my dad works at a healthcare company, I have gained an interest in pharmaceuticals and how evolving technology can greatly be used to improve old methods. In my earlier college days, I had a strong interest in chemistry on the molecular level because of my interest in how the natural world can be manipulated and should be tracked. Being able to find this intersection could greatly improve our traditional methods and push the pharmaceutical industry into a new age. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"I am from Colorado, and so legally, marijuana has been something that is always on the local news.

At the time, my brother was my guardian because both my parents had passed away. I had no interest in computer science, but my brother offered to pay me an allowance over the summer if I agreed to take an online course learning python. By the end of the course, I realized that I wanted to pursue this as a career. This led me to coming to Cal and deciding to major in Computer Science. One of my most meaningful experiences at Cal was joining an organization called Camp Kesem, which is dedicated to supporting children through and beyond their parent's cancer. At Kesem, I work as a summer counselor, and this organization resonates deeply with me because I had gone through a similar experience to the children I help. Working there has sparked an interest in myself to do something good for the world and to actively work to make people's lives better in a meaningful way. I want to combine my love for Data and Computer Science with my passion for helping people in the world.","I hope the Discovery Research program will help me to gain experience to better understand what I want to pursue after graduation in May.

Therefore I am excited for the opportunity to dedicate my time and skills participating in Discovery Research.","I am very collaborative in my approach to Data Science. I find that often times two or more people collaborating on an approach to a problem produces a much better final result than one person alone. Working alone I am sure I will get to a solution, but it will be a solution relative to my own mind set and possible implicit biases, perhaps overlooking details that seem minor to me but very important to others.

Teamwork means being able to both give constructive feedback and being able to take criticism, and being able to learn and improve from it. ",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"This project genuinely just seems really cool - the idea of combining ML and graph algorithms to predict physical properties in materials is something I'd want to learn more about regardless of any research position. Having just taken both a materials science and an algorithms class, the opportunity to bring concepts from both courses together, and to use data science and machine learning techniques to explore how their intersection can be used to predict chemical and physical properties is really interesting to me. In addition, I believe I have enough of a background with all of the topics that this project touches on to get the ball rolling and contribute to the work being done, while also being able to learn and grow as a data scientist.",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"Having just taken a class that covered streaming algorithms, continuing to explore the topic through research, and learning how to implement and use the algorithms for real life data analysis is something that's very interesting to me. Streaming data seems like a very important topic in general given the amount of data that is out there waiting to be processed in any field, be it for the purposes of sentiment analysis or for predicting financial markets, and so it's definitely something I see myself wanting to know more about, and would be a really cool way to further my development as a data scientist. In addition, it also seems to me like this project would be a good opportunity to be able to explore more different parts of the data science pipeline, as streaming presents unique challenges that working with pre-exisiting datasets wouldn't, which would help me further grow as a developer.",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"I'm really interested in exploring linguistics itself just as a subject, and so pairing that with using ML to learn more from the acoustic data that is everywhere around us (I have Siri on my phone, and an Amazon Alexa by my bedside to turn off the lights) seems like a really cool way to learn more about how data science can be applied to real research. I'm not too experienced with NLP or more advanced ML techniques, but want to get involved and learn more about both - these are things I find genuinely interesting and would be willing to spend time learning about whether or not it was part of a research experience or not, and so getting exposed to how these things are used in the real world before diving into coursework is something I definitely want to be a part of.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,Facebook,No,1,

I honestly didn't know much at all about data science before coming to Cal, and I only realized that I actually enjoyed it after taking Data 8 last year. Since then it has come to be a large part of my academic/professional life and I fully plan on learning as much as I can throughout my time at this school. Outside of school, I love basketball, music, and food, and if I'm not working I'm probably doing one of those 3 things. In fifth grade I was on a team with 6-7 of my closest friends, and since then basketball has been a major part of my life. Outside of school I enjoy having time to myself to listen to music, exercise, or just do nothing, but I am always down to do something random with my friends. ","As I stated above, I didn't realize I enjoyed the field of data science until I actually learned some hard skills and was able to actually analyze or create visualizations from data. Through this program, I want to learn and practice even more of these skills, and I will be making tangible contributions to a project that can actually impact a large subset of people. A lot of the projects seem interesting to me personally, and I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to work and learn alongside the researchers.","When I was on that basketball team 9 years ago I learned some lessons about teamwork that I still try to practice today. Back then I was very shy, and didn't feel as confident in my abilities on the basketball court compared to my teammates. As such I wouldn't call for the ball, and didn't really do much with it even if it was in my hands. One practice, my coach practically forced me to shoot the ball every time, and told my teammates to keep passing it to me. This set the basis for my teammates to trust me, and that in turn started to build team chemistry that has lasted to this day as I am still friends with many of them. As such, my approach to teamwork is fairly simple; trust my teammates by communicating with and learning from them, and a good environment/chemistry will develop from that. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I have little experience working with medical data, but the data sources and goal of this project look incredibly interesting to me, and I would be able to gain a lot of experience. Forecasting and improving the AI model seems intriguing. Additionally, as stated in the project description, heart disease is still by far the leading cause of death in both this country and the world. This project looks to improve detection, an outcome that can benefit hundreds of thousands of people, if not more, and I would love to be a part of an impactful project. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"With the legalization of cannabis in more and more states, there still are not many homogenized services and products for purchase and delivery. Part of this, of course, is due to the federal status of cannabis, but I am very interested in delving deeper into this product and analyzing the other underlying causes in such a profitable, yet controversial new market. Personally, I do have some experience with legal cannabis markets, and I possess the skills required in the project description. As such, I can directly apply my experience and skills to the project, and I believe I would be a good addition to the team. ",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"I believe that environmental issues are currently a top 3 problem the world is facing as a whole, and that the lack of proper attention has caused the issue to exacerbate greatly over the past 50 years. We have felt the effects personally with the wildfires and blackouts, and can see similar (and even worse) things happening across the globe.

I came into college with the desire to expand my horizons and was fortunate enough to work on a URAP Project for the past 2.5 years. The project introduced to amazing faculty and the capabilities of my peers at Cal. One of the papers our research generated was used last year at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference and garnered interest from a startup that specialized in an application of our research. I was brought onto that team to work on web development and machine learning and have really grown into the role, expanding what I can do as a developer and what the larger world after academia is like. 

Academically, I really enjoy mathematics and find the math that goes into data science fascinating. In DATA 100, I got a lot of exposure to these kinds of maths and want to work towards building an intuition where I can look at a data sets qualitative properties and determine what models and techniques are most appropriate to apply in relation to getting to the most out of the dataset while maintaining the integrity and rigor I witnessed that goes into academic papers. ","The URAP project I worked on is now completed so I am interested in finding a new research project that I can develop different skills, more closely related to what I'm learning in the classroom. I want to start using the models and algorithms that I learned in DATA 100 to actually study and find new insights. I am really keen on improving my abilities in R, SQL, and frameworks and tools that data scientists use. ","Teamwork is really important to me since I've been a part of a research team and a startup. My approach to teamwork is definitely getting people into some kind of messaging platform, such as Slack. Coordinating meetings with the people I work with directly helps me in getting things done and I find that it keeps me accountable. I enjoy having a team dynamic that is open and honest so if someone does not feel comfortable with being able to finish something before a deadline or feels that what I'm saying might be wrong, they easily can speak up. ",UCSF - Text Classification on Clinical Notes,"My parents being in the medical field has given me a lifelong interest in medicine and the ways I can apply my computer and data science background to improving tools and techniques in the medical field. I am always trying to think of ways of automating and reducing the mental load on medical professionals to integrate technology into the hospital. I find the work, supervised and unsupervised learning, interesting and something that I am currently working on expanding my skillset in. ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,I found streaming to be an interesting computer science problem after gaining exposure to it in CS 170 where we discussed how to approximate and compute information given limited memory spaces but large data sets. ,Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"The projects description very much falls in line with my skillsets. I have worked on scraping projects for UC Berkeley, Northwestern, UToronto, and the UC Berkeley Law School.  I am really interested in financial applications of data science and find the cannabis market very interesting considering the legal perspective on cannabis and the new markets that are opening up every day because of the laws surrounding it.

Within the first 2 months of my first technical drawing class, my shocking lack of skill hit me hard and I decided I had to make a change. I knew I wanted to build, but hardware was not the right approach. So I made the switch into another field I knew nothing about. Fast forward a year from never having written a line of code, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come. Yet my biggest regret remains the fear that mechanical design left with me. So last semester, I chose to face it. I enrolled in a class where over two months, heavily supported by my incredible group, I helped design a toilet-seat cover dispenser. From teaching me how to use a laser cutter in Jacobs to laughing because I kept burning the wood, my team stuck with me throughout and made sure that I was involved in every stage of designing our revolutionary dispenser. If anything, the process left me more aware of my ignorance of everything mechanical than earlier. But I wouldn’t trade a second of it for the world.","Until last summer, I was actively chasing the standard computer science dream of recruiting throughout the year, cracking coding interviews, and landing that golden internship. It all seemed amazing, until I finished my first one. I’d learned a lot no doubt, but most of my work was just replicating models I could look up online. What surprised me more is that my supervisors encouraged this practice. Then, next semester, I got my first taste of research: not with the sciences, but with the government of Meghalaya in India. I got to work with graduate students and government officials to understand the healthcare crisis in the state, develop solutions, and even assist in deploying them on-the-ground. Every week was filled with new challenges, and required constant innovation from my team. That thrill of creative challenges is what I am chasing with Discovery Research. The program’s projects exist at the intersection of several fields and ideas, ranging far beyond data science. This breeds an environment of constant creativity through which I hope to not just expand my knowledge but also relearn what I think I know, not just about my own field of study but also about those of my peers.","Teamwork is as much about knowing when to disagree as when to agree. I’ve always held that belief close, and have made it a point to share it with my teammates to get their views on it before starting work on a project. Throughout junior high, I had a habit of always supporting the majority within group discussions, since at the time it seemed like the most efficient way of converging to a consensus. Then one day, my mentor at the time called me out on this and effectively made me speak out against the popular consensus of my team on one of our school projects. It was a disaster at the time since it was out of nature for me, but since then I’ve learned the value of not just offering differing opinions, but also encouraging the same from everyone on the team. This in turn leads to a team dynamic where everyone has the ability to be frank with each other, and offer constructive criticism, feedback, and even compliments, without feeling awkward. Respectful disagreement is an incredible way to establish a healthy and robust team dynamic, and one I hope to find in any team I get the opportunity to be a part of.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"One of the problems I'm working towards solving is the lack of quality healthcare in India. With a population of over 1.3 billion, accessing healthcare data and analyzing it at the scale done in more developed countries with a smaller population, is a major issue. In particular, I am interested in how graph algorithms can be used to get analytics on healthcare data, especially since much of it is available in largely unstructured formats due to poor and inconsistent collection methods. Through this project, I hope to develop a deeper understanding of graph representations of semistructured and unstructured data, as well as how best to handle such data while optimizing not just the storage it takes up but its security. Furthermore, efficient representations can also aid in indexing within such datasets, which would make distribution of healthcare records across government hospitals much quicker and less error-prone.  I have experience working with algorithm design and cyber security, and will be taking a class on optimization theory this semester to further develop my skillset. I truly see the work being done with this project as ground breaking and having far-reaching applications with the potential to change the lives of millions of people, and would love to be a part of it.",NASA data viz,"Effective data visualization is something I believe is truly important yet often overlooked when it comes to the data exploration process. Last semester, I took my first upper division data science class in which I was exposed to various methodologies behind selecting appropriate visualizations, as well to visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. While I currently have a basic understanding of how to deploy visualizations, I am curious as to whether these same libraries would be deployed in the types of visualizations expected in this project, or if we would be using more complex pieces of software considering the complexity of the data. I am also interested in how data can be represented in non-traditional ways, for instance beyond 2-dimensional plotting. One of the most interesting concepts I learned last semester was that of Principal Component Analysis and how it ties in to reducing the dimensionality of high dimensional datasets. In particular, I am curious as to whether techniques like PCA can be used to improve visualization capabilities by scaling high dimensional data collected from flight simulators down to dimensions where visuals can be understood and interpreted in an effective manner.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"The differences between traditional machine learning and deep learning methods particularly stands out when one looks at the healthcare sector, especially in different types of countries. Conventional supervised learning methods require human-fed features, which can often be inaccurate in the case of medical histories. In many rural areas within India, people are often not aware of their medical family history, and thus may not be able to supply accurate data for models to work with. This is where I see the true potential of deep learning methods, and being able to extract features from images and reports. Healthcare is what I aim to work in once I graduate, in particular, developing powerful software to improve access and distribution. I believe the use of AI methods to strengthen predictions based on images and medical reports is a crucial step in reducing the inequity in access to healthcare between people from different sections of society. Specific to the project, I have experience working with such image detection and DL frameworks before, and would love to see how I could learn from and contribute to the direction this project will take.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,Through a professor,"Taking data 100 last semester opened up a whole new world to me outside of traditional software engineering.

Through the projects I worked on in class to the ones I developed with people outside of school, I've realized how passionate I am about learning as much as I can about the field and research to me is the best way to do so. I hope to contribute to the best of my abilities and learn as much as I can from the mentors in the program and all my peers.",1,

","When I took Data 8 I found it really interesting when the assignments analyzed real data sets like international poverty rates and drug trials, and we were able to draw conclusions and make classifiers with them. With the Discovery Research projects I'd be able to work with more complicated and impactful data, as well as learning directly from researchers with greater expertise. ","When working in teams I think it's really important to establish connections before diving head in to work, so that we can have a sense of the team's characters and build empathy with each other. Doing this makes it more comfortable to communicate; it's easier to ask for help from a team member more skilled in a certain area, or admit a mistake that they made, or delegate tasks to each other.",NASA data viz,"After using Python in my computer and data science courses, I've seen how powerful of a language it can be, so I want to take my knowledge of Python to the next level with this project. Although I haven't had much experience with aeronautics, this is a fascinating field that I'd love to dive into through this project. ",Data for Social Good,"Many of the companies I've seen use data science as a means to predict markets or analyze user experience as a means to increase profits. While this has lead to unprecedented user-product compatibility, I want to see first-hand how data science is also used as a means to help the underrepresented and less fortunate. Data for Social Good's project is a chance to use the skills I was lucky enough to learn and actually better the lives of people with the most need for the power of data. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"A year ago I wrote a research paper on a researcher at UCSF developing an algorithm using machine learning that could detect Alzheimer's progression through PET scans. In an interview the researcher told me it had actually been a fellow Berkeley student who had come up with the idea, and that the project would've never gotten so far without the him. This was one of the moments that inspired me to take my first computer science course the next semester. I realized that there was so much more to computer science than just tech for tech's sake, but it's also a powerful tool that can finally solve centuries-old problems in healthcare.  This project is an amazing opportunity use the skills I've learned in the past year and participate in the revolutionizing of the medical field, especially to improve detection of the one of the leading causes of death in the world.

This was what I told my teacher in third grade. “I like computer science!” This is what I told my robotics teacher in high school. I loved concocting stories and reading books as a child and had no passion for tech whatsoever. Then, I went to high school and felt like a giddy mad scientist learning how to build and program robots. When I learned about the field of data science, it felt like these two strong passions of mine had combined into one beautiful, intensely interdisciplinary field. To me, the ability to creatively manipulate data, reveal underlying relationships and make conclusions about my analyses feels like an elaborate writing of a detective novel. Moreover, the impact data science holds over any and every other field feels like a superpower with my unique signature I can use anywhere and everywhere. However, I was and still am dubious of what effects data science can have in conjunction with analyzing and manipulating human behavior, which is why I major in data science and cognitive science!","While I enjoyed the projects from Data100 and Stat133, I felt like for learning and grading purposes, the projects babied the students through the data life cycle. Every step was neatly outlined with a predicted outcome and the few “free response” style questions were met with confusion and uncertainty. I wanted to tackle the hesitance I felt when solving open-ended data science questions since these questions reflect real world problems. Discovery Research really excites me because it offers an opportunity to explore and exploit my data science knowledge without instructions to hold my hand through every step and with a team to collaborate with. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of program truly highlights the beauty of data science. The research projects combine topics I am interested in with practical data science skills which will allow me to learn more about these topics while furthering my knowledge about data science! I think it will be especially interesting to find new insights using data in a field I have already been exploring such as linguistics or the cannabis market. ","In high school, I spent everyday honing my teamwork skills as the leader of my school's VEX robotics team. These are the lessons I have learned and continued to build on throughout my years in college. First, I believe in creating an open environment so that ideas and constructive criticism can be freely exchanged. It is a responsibility as a teammate to give honest feedback as well as stimulate new approaches and insights by voicing their opinions. Second, strong teams have excellent communication skills. Especially in college where people tend to work remotely and have periodic meetings, communication is essential so the whole team has an idea of what the project’s status is, what each individual person’s responsibilities are, who needs support and much more. Furthermore, a strong link of communication boosts a culture where conflicts and potential issues are brought to light with less hesitation and resolved efficiently. Third, I think a strong sense of responsibility for one’s role and commitment to a team is crucial. These traits allow teammates to trust and depend on each other's work and support. I think they are also a good metric of whether you should stay on a team or not.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"My parents have been interested in investing in the cannabis market since 2015. After viewing countless documentaries about the benefits of medical marijuana, closely following the news on the legalization of recreational marijuana and watching my parents going through the legal hoops to obtain licenses to open dispensaries, I have also become very interested and invested in the cannabis market. Last summer, I was exploring making a B2B marijuana marketplace for marijuana growers and dispensaries and did extensive research on the marijuana industry in Michigan. I also got to learn in-depth from my dad, who was operating a medical marijuana dispensary at the time, about the infrastructure of dispensaries, growers, and distributors as well as the legal requirements for marijuana to be grown and sold legally. I find this budding marijuana industry fascinating, with the legal system that is slow to react to the industry and creating shortages via bad policies, the expected industry's earnings being tanked by a growing black market, and people's reactions to how the government is handling the new legalization of recreational marijuana. I would love to explore the cannabis markets from a data science point of view and research more about the cannabis industry. The cannabis industry is rapidly changing and I think this research topic would reveal some intriguing conclusions.",Data Visualization for User Experience,"I think technology should be accessible to everyone and I would love to work on this project because it focuses on doing just that. As a VR developer, I am constantly thinking about the user’s experience while interacting with my program. I enjoy working with technology that is very human-centric and I would love to contribute in making data science more accessible to researchers. 
While taking Data100, I always enjoyed working with qualitative data, especially text, more than quantitative data. There is an unpredictability to text that makes it delicate, hard to clean and find clear relationships but such an interesting problem. Likewise, we were taught briefly about sentiment analysis which I found fascinating. I am intrigued by how NLP allows you to make inferences about not just the text itself, but also the author who created the text. I would love to learn more about it and incorporate my cognitive science background as well.",Environmental Health Estimator,"My mom was always mindful of environmental health risks and instilled the same concerns in me as a child. When I go to visit my relatives in Korea, everyone wears a mask outdoors and people gauge whether they should do outdoor activities depending on how clear the air looks that day. My parents now live in Flint, Michigan which has become synonymous with water crisis. My parents had the fortune of installing expensive water filters and living at a location that was less impacted by the lead contamination. However, I saw family friends unable to shower and living off donated bottled water they had to pick up from churches. Even to this day, the water crisis problem continues. I believe this project will help raise awareness of environmental health risks and aid people in identifying measures they can take to protect themselves from the risks they are exposed to. Moreover, this project can help prevent severe situations like the Flint water crisis from occurring again in different regions, show the severity of issues and perhaps over time find trends in certain regions of the U.S.  I would love to work on a project that would have an immense positive impact for U.S. residents.

I was born in India, but spent middle-school and the first two years of high-school in Ghana. I then completed 11th grade in India, 12th grade in Nigeria, before finally coming to Berkeley as a freshman. In addition to my locales, my academic interests have also evolved. My first major love was politics, which through my high-school years shifted towards economics. By the time I completed 11th, and then 12th grade, my friends began to influence me towards a mixture of CS and Economics. Now, here I am – a CS and Economics double-major pursuing both of my interests at once. Being somewhat of an intersection between the two, Data Science seems like a natural field for me to pursue. A good blend of the theoretical world of computers and the real-world dominated by human beings, their behaviour and love of money, Data Science is a good way for me to pursue both my academic interests at the same time. I believe my fluidity, both in terms of the places I’ve lived in and my academic interests, allow me to bring a new and valuable perspective my team will appreciate.","	When we study CS/ Data Science at Berkeley, a lot of classes are very theoretical in what they teach. While this is necessary to understand the amazing ideas that are so integral to computing today, there comes a time when every student itches to be able to apply that knowledge and see it come to life. Data science is a field I find interesting having read so much about it and worked a little with it during an internship last summer, not to mention it is a good blend of both my academic passions. I would have taken Data 8 before this semester but I always failed to get in. Thanks to its high demand, the few spots for participating in larger-scale data science projects on campus and in industry are very few, which puts people like me who are new to this field at a disadvantage. I wish to be able to gain a fundamental understanding of the applications of Data Science through participating in Discovery Research. This also gives me the opportunity to work with a set of experienced people from whom I can learn, thus giving me the opportunity to learn a new and very valuable skillset.","	I believe that teamwork is a system of collaboration where the goal of the members is to arrive at a solution is the most efficient possible way, by utilizing and building on each others’ strengths. For me, the last bit is paramount. My approach to teamwork is to have a system such that while each person works on what they are best at, people should also work on something they are not so proficient at. In this way, not only do the less proficient get to learn something new, those experienced in that aspect of the project get a fresh perspective from someone new to the idea. Having worked in group projects in classes, internships, clubs, and other research projects, I believe the entire idea behind teamwork is one of collaborative learning, and value working in a group because I like to talk to people to learn new things and also share what I know, and in the process better solidify my understanding of something I already knew. This is the approach I intend to bring with me to Discovery Research and hope to learn from the amazing group of people around me.",Student Success Analytics Platform,"Something that I have always valued is the sense of community and wanting to help my community, and this project helps me do exactly that. We are all aware of how competitive and difficult life at Cal can be, but the idea of using our skills to help improve our community seems very fascinating to me and is something I would love to be a part of.
This project also gives me the opportunity to apply what I learned about using Tensorflow and other ML libraries to a real-world project. I spent my winter break exploring the applications of these frameworks and would love to be a part of a team with an experienced group of people who can teach me more about creating machine learning algorithms and putting them into practice.  I feel this project really resonates with me and I would be honored to be a part of this team and make a difference in the greater Cal community through my research with this group.",Campus Database for Student Experiential Learning Opportunities,"The sense of community is always one that I felt wherever I have moved to, and helping my community is something I always try to do. With this project trying to help students and make their lives a little easier, I feel I would thrive in this project group, talking strictly about the motive of the research. In terms of the necessary skills, my internship over the summer required me to do some work with SQL databases and setting up APIs. I also have some web-development experience having worked with HTML and CSS in the past. In the event this project is to expand its scope and work towards launching a mobile application, I also have experience in making apps in Swift using XCode. I do not claim to know everything necessary for success in this project, but if I given the opportunity to work with this team, I would love to interact with the other amazing people on this group and learn as much as I can from them. I feel this project really resonates with me and I would be honored to be a part of this team.",Dispatcher algorithm,"In lower division CS classes we always solve puzzles and learn about algorithms that relate to finding the shortest path through a maze/tree/objects etc. CS61B made us learn common path-finding algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm and exams made us solidify our understanding of them, at least in the theoretical sense. But I have always wondered as to their real-life applicability, and this project appears to be able to help me answer that question. Helping design an optimization algorithm that will help me improve the services of one of the cutest delivery bots I know of, in addition to allowing me to interact with an amazing group of people, is an opportunity I would definitely love to take. I spent winter-break learning about the uses and applications of popular ML libraries such as Pandas and Tensorflow, and hope that this project would be a good place for me to test out my knowledge of these frameworks and also give me the opportunity to work with people who are more proficient with these, and maybe even learn from them.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,Facebook feed,NA,1,

One experience that made me interested in such topics was when I learned about how sodium helps to maintain homeostasis. I read about sodium regulation in cells, and I remembered the principle of entropy. I thought to myself, “entropy is disorder in a system. How can homeostasis be cellular balance, but not break the law of entropy?” 

A few days later, it struck me. As the ions move across the semipermeable membrane, there are more options for movement: the ion can stay in place or move across again. There are now more options, reducing the probability of each movement, which leads to entropy. 

This was one of the first times I was able to understand how physics applies to chemistry and biology, and that has been my interest since. 

I’m also very passionate about sports. One of my goals through data science and other computational classes is to be able to predict the outcomes of games using machine learning techniques. I remember during March Madness last year, I was awestruck by how Google algorithms were able to predict multiple stats, and I want to learn how to do that myself. 
","Through discovery research, my goal is to learn more about how computer science and analytical techniques can be used to benefit other scientific fields. Prior to coming to UC Berkeley, I had no experience with computer science. After taking Data 8 and CS 61A, I realized how powerful these tools are for advancing studies in my interests, and I want to learn more about the applications of programming to the natural sciences. My prior research experience was primarily based on building models in a machine shop, and I want to take the next step in my research journey by going into advanced research through the discovery program. Also, for my past research, I always did calculations by hand, but after learning how to program, I have realized how much more in depth and sophisticated my experiments could have been. I now am looking to gain a wider knowledge of the applications of computer science to research, which is why I am applying to this program.  ","My approach to teamwork is to trust my team members to play to their strengths, and encourage each person to be able to teach their aspect of the project to the team. I think the teaching part is important, since it emphasizes how well an individual understands their role, allows others to learn something they aren’t familiar with, and helps everyone stay on task if some extenuating circumstance comes up. However, the most important thing, I believe is trust. Understanding that there is trust between members allows for each person to take pride in their work and not want to let others down. When I teach at elementary schools with other students, we all trust each other to understand the lesson plans and have fun ways of explaining it. Furthermore, if we are teaching a lesson that one person is well versed, we will let them take the lead while the rest of us handle materials or keeping the class calm. I think this worked really well for my groups the past three semesters, and I’m confident it will continue to work. ",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"The application of this project to energy related structures sparks my interest since I have past experience in piezoelectric energy harvesting. Much of my past projects involved understanding the proper orientation of materials and optimizing their structures for maximum power outputs. This project seems like a perfect opportunity to bridge my past research experience in materials science with my interest in understanding how computational techniques are applicable to natural science research. I’m also fascinated by how this can be further applied to drug development. For one, understanding the intricacies of molecules at a deeper level has the potential to dramatically expand how we create new medicines and test them. I think the opportunities for this are widespread; not just drug development, but also environmental remediation, and disease progression, just to name a few. I would love the opportunity to learn more about such techniques and value the prospect at working on such a project. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"In high school, I built a sweat sensor that alerted people if they were about to have hyponatremia, in the hopes of preventing possible problems that could occur, such as brain damage or cardiac arrhythmias. The idea was pretty straight forward; once the sensor detected a salt level low enough, it would send an alert. I found this project really interesting, and I would love to expand on that experience into more complex biosensors. I think this project would be a good opportunity to learn more about how computational techniques are important for making a complex problem simpler by balancing numerous variables effectively in order to provide an accurate output. I believe this would be a really insightful project, and I am excited at the prospect of being part of such a project. ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"I think it sounds very interesting how we are constantly receiving new information and understanding how to process that data, give some priority, and filter out the noise can help make decisions. I’m not very familiar with how this happens, so this project sounds like a great learning experience to understand more about what computational techniques are being used in industry and why they are important.

I lived on one of the busiest streets in town where there was very little options for affordable healthy foods, and rare sightings of green scenery. People often question my why I decided to major in ""Society & Environment"" within CNR; however, I tell them I will probably never switch out. My major allows me to understand how environmental measures can be leveraged to tackle urban issues. I am particularly interested in Replate, a Berkeley-founded non-profit whose mission is to redistribute surplus food to the hungry. I am also fascinated by Social Bite, an organization that hires homeless persons to run sustainable restaurants.

Aside from my academic interests, I value leadership, optimism, and people! My leadership standpoint is that a great leader does not lead a herd of followers, but uplifts the next body of leaders. It is not status that leaders should care about, but about relationship-building.","Before matriculating into college, I immediately crossed off the idea of participating in research because it seemed too intimidating. I possessed no formal experience in research before. Now that I am in college, my curiosity for data and new knowledge has grown immensely. 

Through Discovery Research, I want to be equipped with fundamental research skills, such as learning how to read scholarly papers, advance-search topics, determining different types of statistics, and formulating meaning out of big-data. I really like this program in particular because it encourages us to unravel research not by ourselves but with people. I feel that I will not only learn new things through the content, but from the others I will be working with.","Teamwork is hard. It is hard because everyone needs to be motivated and put in the effort to contribute to the overall goal. I believe that there is always a place for someone in a group setting. Typically when I start a project with a team, I ask everyone what they are skilled at or interested in. This way, we work together to divide the work based on what people are comfortable with doing, but also trying to disseminate tasks that they can learn to do with someone else. Teams are not meant to breed competition with thoughts arising of who can do what ""best"" and the ""fastest."" They are spaces for people to share intellect, grow, and collaborate.",Data Enabled Donations,"In high school, I served for three years in a very under-resourced student governance. This environment taught me to how to ask for, coordinate, and collect food and supply donations for our organization through outreach platforms and donation tools such as SignUpGenius.com. Throughout the years, I have been fascinated by online communities such as those on Facebook, NextDoor (a neighborhood-based social networking app), and groups like “Food Pantry” on Reddit that are organically created for users to altruistically ship items through Amazon or give in-person when others are in dire need. I believe that even if people do not have physical items to donate to emergency shelters, there are alternate ways they can help bring in more donations. One example is that they can volunteer to drive to pick up the many free items posted on sites like Craigslist, Nextdoor or Facebook.
This is my top choice research project choice because I want to learn how to center my actions around data and strategize ways to better provide for people suffering losses. In this research project, I want to closely examine data stemming from the power of social media, corporate involvement, correlations between different disasters and public responses, and mediums in which people organize donation drop-offs. As someone who comes from a disadvantaged community, I understand the importance of securing resources to all who suddenly enter a high-risk and vulnerable situation.",Cal Alumni Association Analysis of Engaged Alumni,"UC Berkeley was my dream school since elementary school. Everyday I am in awe that I get to live out my dream as a first-generation, low-income scholar. I know that in order to maintain the quality and scale of our education, opportunities, and diversity of our institution, it requires a large and active alumni network.
The Cal Alumni Association reminds me much of my high school’s PTSA. I served as the Student Liaison for three years where I collaborated with parents, teachers, and staff to get them involved in school affairs such as volunteering to manage our bustling website, running our annual Auction & Gala which raises more than $100,000 each year, and supporting us financially to cover AP exams fees, field trips, and school supplies.
	During the fall semester, I worked 10 hours every week at an events and fundraising firm. In my role, I track over hundreds of clients and companies, updating their contact information, phoning for endorsements, contributions, in-kind donations, and more.
	I enjoyed my time engaging affiliated audiences in-person. Now, I want to take a step back to scrutinize the data.

Berkeley has always been my dream school and being accepted from out of state to Berkeley was a dream come true for me. I entered as MCB and in my sophomore year I took data science and it helped me realize what I wanted to do. All my life I have prepared myself for a career in biological sciences, whether it be doing wet-lab research or taking majority of classes in biological sciences. However, I have always loved learning various things so taking those specific classes sometimes felt restricting. After taking data science I realized there is a vast majority of disciplines that one can apply data science to. It was the perfect outlet to explore and help other causes/ research using the foundations of what you learn in CS and Data Science classes. Now I hope to expand my knowledge in data science and get to work with what I have been learning.
Two areas of academia I enjoy outside of Data Science are biology and language. I have been involved in many labs and experiences concerning biology. I enjoyed my experience collecting data and analyzing it to help postdocs make conclusions about studies in neuro-oncology or muscular dystrophy. Biological sciences have always fascinated me since a young age and I hope to continue learning more about it alongside my data science curriculum. Language has also been another subject that interests me. Since middle school I have taken French and excelled. I am now taking classes in Korean to challenge myself in learning languages that don’t use the latin alphabet. So far I am enjoying it thoroughly. I love learning new languages because it gives me an outlet to learn how others communicate and how diverse language really is. Luckily this love for learning languages comes in handy in my computer science classes. ","I hope to learn more about how data science can be applied to different projects. I want to see and be part of applying data science to solve real world issues. I also want to work alongside other motivated students, learn from them, and bounce ideas and thoughts off each other. It is fascinating to me to be in Berkeley surrounded by all these students driven to explore and cultivate their passions to the fullest and I hope to be immersed in that energy and drive in Discovery Research. As someone who has just started their path towards data science  I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn what working in data science is like.",For me the most important aspect of teamwork is communication. Proper communication can help the team grow and learn. I want to be someone who facilitates this and makes everyone’s ideas feel welcomed. I have found that this environment is best to allow people to share innovative ideas or discuss our disagreements in a respectful manner where we learn from our discussions. I think it is also important that everyone contributes and takes pride in their work. Having all team members contribute and communicate with each other will let us reach our goal and go even further.,Automated Water Purification,"I would love the opportunity to work on this project because it helps solve address one of our most basic needs, clean water. There are thousands of places in the US and world where clean water is not available. To work on creating an app that can monitor purification systems and hopefully stop a problem before it happens would be a privilege. As a molecular environmental biology major I want to help work on issues that are in our environment and have it help our population.

I've always enjoyed peaceful, almost meditative runs in the mornings and evenings, and recently started running half-marathons and marathons to put my fitness to the test. I especially like running outdoors, and occasionally find myself exploring new areas. In general, staying healthy and maintaining fitness are a few of my top desires.

This interest in my own health is what drives my primary domains of interest -- physiology and healthcare. I constantly seek ways to improve my physical well-being, whether it be a new cooking recipe or a new workout. But perhaps more importantly, I focus on why these recipes or workouts are better -- what muscle are they targeting, and how are they targeting them differently?

","Through participation in the Discovery Research program, I hope to gain valuable data analysis experience pertinent to health industries, as well as build meaningful connections with other researchers who share a similar passion.

At a deeper level, I want to contribute to research that will improve our understanding of the human body. The hope is that this will motivate changes to current individuals' and institutions' practices, and drive focused medical innovations that will help everyone not only live longer, but live better.","I believe being an effective ""team player"" means finding your role in a group effort where you don't impede the ability of others, while simultaneously poising yourself in a position that is prepared to help them at any time.

I think the meaning is most evident in a soccer game example (relevant sidenote: I played soccer for 9 years, and have played all positions extensively): The golden [unspoken] rule of soccer is to not ball-hog. Coaches often tell players to pass frequently, in order to deter ball-hogging. In my experience, however, ball-hogging is often not on purpose; if your teammates don't position themselves well enough, you can't successfully pass the ball -- and thereby are forced to ""ball-hog"" until they do. Now, a technicality is to just stand right next to your friend and pass it between the two of you, but that just creates larger opportunities for error, and diminishes the number of options you have when you get in a pinch. The lesson? Be ready to help your teammates at any time, but don't be overburdening them the entire way.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"When I was working at the Beaver Works Summer Institute a couple years ago, I was introduced to waveform data and was immediately encaptured by the profound, albeit latent insights that could be derived from this type of data.

I started with cIvil engineering. After taking data 8, and later data 100, I’ve decided that doing data science and machine learning is something that I really want to pursue further. I’m driven by the flexibility that data science provides by being incredibly interdisciplinary with all fields of science and engineering.Going forward, I plan to get teaching experience as a group tutor for Data 100 next semester, and begin getting involved in research and internships (like this one!)

I am especially interested in applications of data science and civil engineering which I am currently studying. Things like energy, environmental factors, and transportation are all an important part of people’s everyday lives, and I am especially interested in how innovation and change can be achieved in those areas. 
","Through the research conducted through this program, I hope to gain a better understanding of a specific field of study/industry, improve my skillset as a data scientist, and create an impactful end product.

I hope that by working on a project will give me experience on that topic, and how data science can be applied to it. I really want to see what’s out there, and the many different new and innovative things that people are working on.

Another benefit I hope to achieve through the program is simple to improve my skillset and learn new libraries, languages, and techniques that will allow me to be a better data scientist. This will give me hands on experience beyond what I’ve learned in data 8, and data 100, and I hope to use these skills in the real world going forward. 

Lastly, at the end of the program, I hope to have worked on something impactful and useful towards the goal of the project. I’m obviously not expecting it to be some groundbreaking million dollar idea, but being able to have my efforts contribute to something is one of my goals for research.
","Listen to your teammates.
Communicate clearly and effectively.
Be willing to offer and request help.
Share your concerns and questions.
Lead by example. 

Above I listed a bunch of very simple, but important things for a team. I don’t really think there’s any magic formula to creating a perfect team. All you need are a group of people who are all collaborating together and doing the above things. If so, then everyone will be on the same page, have the same expectations, and be able to utilize the individual strengths of its members. 
",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"I actually worked on a project that was sort of similar at UCSD before. It involved collecting air samples and analyzing various levels of particulate emissions at different locations around the school. Reading over the clarity movement website, I think this is definitely a project I want to be involved in. It is a large impactful project that can impact and help the health of entire cities. It also has some overlap with environmental engineering. This is an example of using tech (Internet of things) to tackle a larger problem for many, and that’s the type of project I want to be a part of.
",NASA data viz,"Data visualization is incredibly important for data science. It lets us really understand out data, and begin to visualize and see trends and patterns. The NASA project lists a very interesting application for developing data visualization tools, and looks like it will pose quite a challenge. I think this project will be incredibly rewarding as it will allow us to build something from the ground up and not just use a prebuilt library for data visualization. This project is interesting due to its nature in building up a specific data visualization tool for a very particular application, something that will be both a rewarding challenge and great learning experience. ",Kiwibot delivery robots,"I think the optimization challenges posed by the kiwibot service is very complex. There are incredibly large number of factors at play that our little kiwi friends have to deal with: pedestrians, traffic, surrounding environment, restaurant locations and more. I think it will be an interesting application of the data skills I currently have to take all that information and try to optimize the delivery system.

After interning as a Data Science Researcher at Children’s Hospital, Los Angeles this past Summer, I realized that my main interest lies in clinical research. Working with biological data-- a topic which I didn’t have any formal training in-- inspired my enrollment in biology courses for my upcoming semester. I hope to eventually work in the field of clinical Data Science research and am trying to get as much exposure as possible in my time as an undergraduate student. Outside of Data Science, my interests include mathematics as well as music. I have explored many courses in both fields at Berkeley, and I am minoring in Mathematics as well as teaching a DeCal which is a combination of Armenian music history and an Armenian Choir.

While individual work is a very important aspect of progress within a project, working with others to discuss ideas is very necessary in order to allow for rationalization of the ideas that have been set forth. I am very supportive of the concept of teamwork, and when working in a team setting I try to allow for all ideas to be heard and discussed before taking any actions or making decisions. When working independently within a group project, I make sure to have regular meetings which allow for an open discussion regarding every member’s work to keep the team on the same track as well as think through the thought process of each member. For example, when working on a group research project over the semester, we allotted individual tasks for each person during the week, then had a summary meeting once a week to discuss our methods, thought processes, and results. Here, we allowed for all constructive criticism regarding the progress, to allow for a dialogue on outside opinions. I believe this form of teamwork is a vital part of progress in any group setting.

I read in an essay once something along the lines of  ""if the scientific method is the process by which we obtain knowledge about the world, then science itself is merely that body of knowledge which has been validated according to the method."" To me this was significant because it suggests that really the boundaries between subjects such as biology, data science, philosophy, history, etc. are really just conventions. In other words, I believe there really is just one body of knowledge, one truth, one UNIverse to be explored.

It can be hard to establish these things with a team that hasn't worked together before, but it is essential for the sustainability of the team in my view. Eliminating barriers to good communication such as fear of being wrong or other potential sources of social friction is a good place to start. ",UCSF - Text Classification on Clinical Notes,Primarily I am interested in using data science to improve health care. I also want a project that allows me to utilize the machine learning techniques I have learned in my coursework. ,UCSF - Knowledge Representation and Discovery from a large Clinical Text Corpus,The information blurb for this project was very short and suggests the problem is very open ended. This is particularly interest to me because it means I would really be able to mine for information that really might not have been found yet. The vagueness of the problem statement suggests potentially multiple insights which is an attractive thought. I also think this project will complement the course I am taking this semester on natural language processing very well. ,Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"This particular project interested me because it deals with objects that can't be represented as feature vectors, which are typically the data objects used in the courses I have taken. As someone who is interested in both biology and data science, I would like to learn more about how to represent objects (such as a molecule mentioned in the description) for machine learning purposes.

I was previously a political science and economics dual major and recently changed from political science to data science. Last semester I took Data 100 and CS 61A in order to gain a stronger foundation in data science and am hoping to use this semester to apply skills I learned in those classes. Because I picked up data science somewhat late, I'm hoping to utilize UC Berkeley's resources to tackle engaging, real world problems.

In previous semesters, I've conducted political research under URAP at the university law school. Here, I explored the effect of temporary U.S Senate appointments on Senate elections, and the effect that local and state policy have on the California housing crisis. While I've focused mostly on political research and basic data exploration, I'm hoping to explore different topics and to engage in data analysis requiring more technical skills and analysis. 

Outside of school, I enjoy reading the news, keeping up with politics, cooking, and photography. I've also recently started traveling more during my breaks to take advantage of being a students and have really enjoyed seeing different parts of the world. I was born and raised in the Bay Area and never left so getting to see different cultures and geographies has been an amazing experience. ","I hope to apply data science skills I’ve learned in the classroom to real world projects and questions. While class projects from analysis on presidential elections to bike sharing usage has provided me with a strong foundation for conducting data exploration and analysis, I want to gain experience in handling current issues with undiscovered solutions. 

In addition, I’d like to improve on basic data science skills such as in programming, data visualization, and data interpretation. Especially because data science can be so open ended, I’d like to sharpen my data science intuition and learn how to approach certain problems and recognize when certain data science tools should be applied. 

Lastly, as a former URAP apprentice, I also believe that research addresses important questions that would otherwise be left unanswered. In participating in Discovery Research, I’d like to continue helping answer these crucial questions in order to contribute to society and the research community. 
","When approaching teamwork, I first acknowledge that each l team member has strengths and weaknesses. For example, someone may be more comfortable with statistical analysis but less skilled with data cleaning. In most projects, tasks should be delegated by areas of strength so that those most efficient with a task can handle it efficiently. However, it’s extremely important to discuss with other team members even if they’re less skilled at the task. This helps the team better understand the overall problem while allowing for others to suggest different approaches. For example, in one URAP project I worked on, while each apprentice was delegated a specific California city to research, we had regular meetings so researchers could share findings and better understand the entire problem we were seeking to analyze.

Furthermore, while team members should work on tasks they’re most efficient with, they shouldn’t shy away from assignments outside of their comfort zone. In this case, I like to reach out to help teammates when they’re struggling with certain tasks, and to ask others for help when I’m struggling. Through this, I try to make teamwork efficient while also addressing, rather than simply ignoring, the weaknesses that each team member may have. 
",Data visualization and analytics for off-grid solar in Africa,"Having recently taken a course regarding case studies in African development, I’m fascinated by research which helps solve issues in African development. From studies on the impact of deworming school children in Kenya to the impact financial stability has on violence within African communities, research in Africa as a region provides viable solutions to complex problems. One particular research project I analyzed in this course looked at the effect of electrifying rural villages in Kenya. While the costs of electrifying these villages is high due to lack of previous infrastructure, the willingness to pay for electricity in these regions is low despite the growing need of electricity in daily life. 

By participating in Catalyst Off-Grid Advisors’s projects on off-grid solar in Africa, I hope to explore solar as a more viable electricity source in Africa. Especially because solar is efficient both environmentally and economically, it can prove to be a strong private-sector solution to a major issue in African development.

Furthermore, I’m interested in applying data science skills learned in the classroom to support the business functions of a growing startup. As an economics and data science dual major, I particularly hope to gain experience using data to drive decision making in business settings while also contributing to a greater cause. 
",Assessing Research Usability for Development Practitioners in Southern Africa,"Having recently taken a course regarding case studies in African development, I’m fascinated by research in African development. From studies on the impact of deworming school children in Kenya to the impact of providing electricity to rural African villages, academia and research in Africa as a region provides viable solutions to complex problems. Especially because Southern Africa is now experiencing positive economic trends, it’s important to continue solving regional issues to further improve standard of livings. Furthermore, research findings in Southern Africa can be used to influence not only African policy, but also the policy of other developing countries such as those in Southeast Asia. This makes research accessibility particularly important in a period where well informed policy decisions are vital for modern development. 

I’d like to contribute to this growing field of development economics while also gaining real world experience in collecting data. I’ve learned about different data collection methods such as randomized control trials through statistics and economics courses and want to practice knowledge learned in the classroom in an impactful project contributing to the research community. 
",Environmental Health Estimator,"Having analyzed the negative effects of environmental health risks on communities in economics courses, I’m curious about how certain environmental factors can negatively influence health outcomes.

This is because I can utilize my programming skills to help solve real world problems. For example, I completed Gitlet from first writing lines of design document. As I see that my codes will improve user experience and help others' lives to be more convenient, I feel that my technical skills in data analysis and programming is pretty useful.
Besides programming, I am also interested in exploring theoretical foundation behind models and algorithms that data scientists use. This is the reason why I choose to double major in applied math and data science. As a math major, I will strengthen my knowledge in mathematics and probability, so that I can ensure that models that we are going to train with huge data set is correct, and our algorithms are optimized to be efficient. This is really important as a foundational step from my experience. As a data science major, I can gain more programming experience in CS curriculum at Berkeley. These project experiences, such as Discovery program, allow me to learn and apply technical skills to solve real world problems.
After taking Prob 140 last semester, I became interested in quantitative research and trading position. This is an intersection of computer science programming and probability statistics. I completed an individual open source project in data visualization and analysis of stock trading prices, which is started by JP Morgan Chase Trading Division. I developed front-end and back-end platform of data visualization and analysis of real time stock prices data. My platform will provide real time visualization of relationship between multiple stock prices and perform numerical analysis in their historical trends and performance. With supports in algorithms and models, it will provide alerts in potential advantages in buying or selling certain stock as correlation between different stocks increases or weakens.
This experience further leads me to see intersection of data science with other subjects and application fields, which is what Discovery program widely provides.","I can learn more about how data science research methods are applied in diverse social science backgrounds. This experience will build up and strengthen my path to pursue a Ph.D program in Statistics and Machine Learning related fields, which I am really interested in.
The Discovery Research Program is both a deeper and broader exploration of technical skills I develop at Berkeley and understandings of other subjects as I took these courses. For example, I have learned a wide variety of data science techniques and programming principles in Data 8, Data 100, CS 61A and CS 61B. And I have seen how these skills are combined and applied in the industry, during my experience of working on a data analytics consulting project for a sports analytics company at Data Science Society. Currently, I am passionate to explore how these skills are applied with theoretical knowledge of maths and stats in data science research. On the other hand, I have explored a wide variety of subjects from economics and business to sociology and linguistics. By applying data science research techniques that I am adept at into these fields, I will pursue my academic interests in these fields and deepen my understanding of college level courses through Discovery Research Program. Thus, I will better understand and deliver technical skills and knowledges I learn from courses, explore diverse subjects by communicating with professors from different backgrounds, and strengthen my path to succeed as a Ph.D candidate in statistics in the future.","I always emphasize the role of communication and agreement when working in a team. This is because I think that best ideas are always developed in partnership with others. As either a team lead or a team member, I am willing to work with people, communicate well with others by clearly expressing my opinions, actively listening to my members, and mediate any conflicts that arise.
Also, I really appreciate every member utilizing his or her specialities and advantages to improve our working efficiency. At the beginning of projects, I appreciate being able to learn my team members' expertise, strategize approaches with them, and mutually assign specific tasks to each member so that everyone can finish their independent task in their free time. This will definitely speed up the whole process of group projects by combining the advantage of teamwork and working independently.
Most importantly, I have to ensure that the atmosphere of our team is harmonious and peaceful, creating a welcoming and free environment for higher quality and more efficient works. I am usually the one who organize, schedule, and follow up progress of every member during group project because I always work reliably in great detail. If I recognize problems influencing working progress of my member, I will definitely help find out what's happening and solve the problem immediately. Usually these issues and conflicts can be solve via communications and clarifications.",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"My previous open source project experience also deals with visualization and analysis of real time streaming data, with application in real time stock price data. Link: https://github.com/xinranliang/JPMC-tech
As I finish this project, I realize the convenience that streaming data analysis provides to stock traders in their decision making process. However, there are still several improvements that can be made in order to make this system more efficient. The largest one I can think of is how to improve accuracy of generating alerts and warnings to traders, about when to buy or sell certain stock and how to maximize future return in investment. With my previous experience in programming, probability and prediction inference, and project experience, I will be a good fit for this research project.",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I have had three semesters of experience in data visualization and analysis, from data 8 to project developer at data science society to prob 140. I am confident that my strong technical skills will allow me to become a competitive candidate for this project. As a data science major, I am interested in applying my technical skills in programming, web development, and python libraries to solve real world problem. Here, to help analyze a historical social issue is what I look forward to help with.
As an advocacy of women in tech industry, this will be a great opportunity to add more experience and persuasive evidence about overview of women in tech industry. With clear results with data visualization and analysis, I look forward to understand more about historical development of women in tech industry.",Data Enabled Donations,"This project really solves a problem, because it will provide a solution to optimize supply and demand of physical donations that shelters receive following a disaster.

I look forward to work with experts from different fields, support the government to make more informed and time efficient decisions for the public and cooperate to figure out a better way of modeling.
My strong academic background makes me stand out as a strong candidate for this project from technical perspective. Currently I cannot think of what technical skills besides programming, data visualization, and data analysis will be useful in this project. However, with strong background in mathematics and computer science, I am willing to and will be a quick learner to grasp ideas of different skills that will be useful in this project.

The bottom stitch of one of the letters were a bit off, but neither of us could say with certainty that it was a significant evidence. He was upset with his potential loss, but I got an inspiration from it. What if we can develop an algorithm that automate this process and check these standards for buyers? I started doing research on machine learning algorithms on imaging and scraping the web for close-up pictures, hoping to solve this problem creatively with the modern tools that I have, and I want to keep training myself to be able to connect more technological solutions to more real-world problems.","Discovery Research is a great opportunity for me to apply my knowledge and skills to identify, analyze, and solve real problems. I want to gain a first-hand experience on how to systematically approach a problem, and further train my problem-solving mentality. At the Discovery Research Showcase of 2019, I was very impressed with what the teams have accomplished in just one semester. A project led by WAHVE effectively solved multiple problems at once: ineffective use of human resources, mental health of the elderly, the pressure on the young, and potentially the overall economy. After talking with the interns with the WAHVE team, I realized that clarity about the pain point of our society combined with modern data science techniques can produce powerful results. I think Discovery Research offers precisely that, which is a great way to make an impact in the real world with guidance from people with a vision and a team of supports with passion and skills.  
","I love working in teams, and the most important things I look for in a team is common mission, communication, sense of responsibility, and mutual support. If I am the leader of a team, I would first build a collective mission. It will not only constantly remind the team of our end goal, but also invoke a sense of belonging. I would make a clear and detailed timeline of our project to help everyone stay on track, and also gain clarity and confidence for our project. Next, I would make it clear that it is a safe environment to talk and encourage constant communication. I would even set in place some rules to mandate communication in the beginning if the team is not very active, such as partner system, weekly report, and so on. If I am a member of the team, I would be supportive of my teammates, transparent with everyone, especially the group leader. I would stay on my workflow and try my best to help others who are behind, taking initiatives when my expertise is needed. I would bring to the table the important traits I look for in a teammate and incorporate others’ expectation as well.

One of the ways that I proposed was to refine the customer review section of my client's website. The traditional ways of presenting traveler reviews are not in favor of the hotels.For example, customers with bad experiences tend to write more in details and get more attention, the topic classification leaves out important information, and customers are usually more strict with ratings than comments, etc. So, I wanted to come up with a system that enables more objective representation of customer feedback that will not only increase the booking of rooms, but also provide useful information for the company.  I provided them this proposal and an initial design, but I was not completely satisfied with my solution.

However, I was initially an Environmental Science major coming here. During my first semester, I took Data 8, was intrigued by how much we can do with all sorts of data, and decided that I want to be a data scientist. Data Science has since become one of my greatest hobbies: I worked on interesting projects with friends, and I would always browse Medium and other platforms to learn what’s going on in this promising field.
Outside of data science, I also enjoy teaching. I’ve been lab assisting my favorite class Data 8 for two semesters now. I took a CS Pedagogy class this semester where I tutored more than 20 students and absolutely loved it! Looking at the students’ faces when they eventually understand a problem because of my explanation is one of my favorite moments this semester.
I also eat out sometimes with friends, jog, binge-watch a lot of Netflix shows, and constantly check FlightRadar24 to see what planes are flying over Berkeley.
","Although I’ve done some data science projects, those were all on our own—we chose what we want to do and what we want to achieve—and exploratory. Through this program, I hope I can apply the classes I’ve taken thus far and the experiences accumulated through these projects to real-world projects with clear objectives. It would be fulfilling to see the work I did influencing a real-world decision or shedding some light on little known academic fields.
Additionally, I want to become more experienced in data science, and that includes adding more programming languages and analysis tools to my toolkit and discover new approaches to various data-driven problems, both of which I think I can gain from this program. Taking part in any of the uniquely-themed projects this semester would greatly improve my skills.
","I think the most important part of teamwork is communication. It is integral to the functioning of the whole team: from missing a deadline to proposing a change of focus, teamwork work would become much more efficient with clear and effective communication.
Typically when working in a team, I would make sure that I know what the team’s objective is and what I will be responsible for doing in the team by asking the team lead. In the case where I’m the lead, I will clearly convey the idea to my teammates and make sure we are on the same page. For each individual task, I will clarify or ask for clarification about what I need to do, what the expected outcome would be, and of course what the deadline is. When doing my own share of things I will absolutely adhere to the deadline. I would also periodically check in with my teammates about their progress to ensure they don’t fall behind. Under the very unlikely circumstances where I’m missing a deadline, I would communicate with my teammates as soon as possible.
",NASA data viz,"One thing I love about data science is its ability to utilize numerous data and novel methods to shed new light on other subjects, especially, in this case, it’s the subject that I enjoy. 
I’m always fascinated by the world of civil aviation. Everything from how an aircraft is assembled to how a certain route might differ from time to time; from how to steer an aircraft to ETOPS and airports. I can spend hours just staring at those Pilots’ Eye videos. Their elegant commands and prompt responses have made me really want to learn more about planes and flying. Therefore, this project would be a great opportunity for me to apply what I learned in data science classes to the area I’m passionate about. 
This project also involves writing software, which, although I had experience writing substantial functioning software in classes, is new to me in the real world. I’m excited to be writing software that will be put into real use.
",Sumerian Network Analysis,"I love data science because one can utilize numerous data from the real world and novel computer science and statistical methods to shed new light on other subjects, even largely unrelated to the computer science world. Although I barely know anything about Sumerian language and Mesopotamia, I am curious as to how data science can assist historians in interpreting this ancient culture. It’s also exciting to learn more about this culture through this project.
Natural Language Processing is my favorite branch of data science and machine learning. It’s intriguing to see machines interpreting human languages. I worked with Trump tweets in a project last semester and it was a great experience. Applying similar techniques to a fundamentally different language (it’s in different shape and only exist in ancient artifacts) would be an interesting challenge!

A drastic change in lifestyle meant I had to step out of my comfort zone.

	print(“Have always had this interest for flight simulators, and fancy the experience of a flight deck, pursued through various games and movies about airlines”)","The UC Berkeley Discovery Program is data-centric and serves as an amazing opportunity for budding data scientists. However, with such widespread exposure of potentially powerful data, there arises a need to carefully and ethically use this data. My interest in responsible data use practices was initiated by authoring a research paper on the activities of Facebook concerning stakeholders’ big data. During this research project, I also came across a book called Weaponized Lies, which made me even more cautious about how numbers and statistics can be manipulated to tell any story. Thus, I aim to gain a sense of giving back to my community by further exploring how best to use Big Data and sharing my findings.

Moreover, I love how the Discovery Program projects are research-driven and employ the curiosity and flexibility associated with research projects. I am thrilled to further develop my inquisitiveness by actively pursuing relevant research for the project I am selected for. 
Lastly, as a data science major, this is an amazing opportunity to gain first-hand experience by working on real-life projects that allow us to implement the technical skills learned inside the classrooms. I have a newfound love for Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, Web Scraping and Data Manipulation among others that I wish to develop further through participation in this program. 
","Being comfortable both as a team member and a team lead, I ardently advocate for an affiliative team approach. I believe the secret to excellent and successful teamwork lies in the happiness of each individual team member, which can only be fueled by recognizing the incentive of the team members as the top priority. Thus, the category of work assigned should be in harmony with the personal goals of the team member, thereby providing an incentive to pursue the work wholeheartedly, even if that means unequal distribution of workload among the team members in the short run. A happy team learns to gradually develop a familial attitude towards each other and rejoices in the happiness of the fellow members thereby further increasing the motivation to work. 

I have tried to constantly implement this approach as part of Cal Cricket, a sports club on campus. For instance, when deciding the final playing 11 squad travelling to the nationals tournament in Florida in a Board meeting, I recommended we prioritized players passionate in their game even if it meant a slightly less than optimal skill balance in the squad. As it turned out, this was the key factor to pick my team-mate who ended up being the man of the match in the quarter-final game, who almost missed out on making it to the squad.
",NASA data viz,"As I mentioned, I've always been fascinated by flight decks and the airline industry. Thus, I would be thrilled to work towards building a simulator display that allows ""play back"" using my Python coding experience developed over the semesters. In my past research experience, I have had experience with cleaning and mixing data sets from various sources thereby, I believe, making me sufficiently capable of linking behaviors in different data types (captured by the simulator, by eye tracker, or by manual annotations). Furthermore, the analysis of various measures such as time and frequency will allow me to develop my technical skills in various Data Science fields even further. Overall, this sounds like a really exciting project for me!",Computational Analysis of Social Science Research,"As I mentioned, I've recently been fascinated by the potential of Natural Language Processing and the intersection of social science and technology.

In Guardamar, we were asked to come up with a plan for the future including an architectural design. Since our team focused on tourism, we intended for a festival that connects the town with its legacy. But problems remain: how many people could this town hold? How long would the pilgrimage tour be? How to build our activity center in the sand dunes? The first instinct I had was to use data. From the city council reports I was able to find the patterns of tourists in different seasons and the revenues incurred. We walked the whole city and measured the numbers by our feet—how long, how tired would the walk be, what kind of activity to put in between. I put together all those data for them to work together, resulting in an experience design: in what season, who would come in, what kind of activity, what kind of walk, where has supply, which perspective of culture we are showing, and what kind of meaning this walk has. But we were unable to actually prove that our building could stand in the sand because we did not have the professional knowledge, with precise data, how this could work, nor the ability to put those data in visualization to explain its feasibility. That is when I realized the practical use of data. This experience filled in the gap between the theory in data8 and the reality. But still, the gap remains, which is why I am applying to this program. ","I wish that I could fill a bit more the gap between theory and reality. Through the URAP project last semester, the link between raw data to visualization was clearer. I learned how to clean data from the raw data pulled from government websites, analyze data by programming data into all kinds of visualizations using d3 and d4 library in R. Putting numbers into maps or graphs would shed light on approaches toward our problem. However, questions remain: what is the link between visualizations and impact? How to make the visualization meaningful and use them somewhere? How to target a problem and collect the appropriate data to solve it? I believe this program would fill in some of the important misses of the puzzle. ","I think teamwork is about communication and support. With the same goal in our minds, we first need to communicate. For instance, what is everyone good at? What is preferred to do? What kind of cooperation are we expecting? After laying the ground for everyone, we would be able to assign appropriate tasks and plan the process and pace for the program. During the process, support and communication is inseparable. If anyone has a problem, it should be communicated for help to solve. Support among all teammates does not limit to only help but also emotionally and socially. I encountered friends in the URAP program of eco data lab, who share the same goal as I do, who is so active and thoughtful, who has so much care for the environment and so much talent. This feeling of belonging, welcomed and supported is inexplicable. I hope that I would be able to again, communicate and support in Discovery Research.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"i think this program suits me best both academically and personally. My majors are economics and data science and this program perfectly matches with the courses and skills I have learned through these two majors. In addition, with experience in Model UN, I had always been interested with the commercialization of cannabis.

I speak three languages - English, Mandarin, and Arabic. I value four things - curiosity, dedication, community and changes. Academically, I'm interested in data science's application for social goods, especially with a domain in indigenous health and poverty alleviation. My interning experience at an AI development group not only improved my skills in data analysis, report conduction, and communication, but also boosted my confidence in using data for community enhancement. My interests in indigenous health and derived from my blood. I was born into a long succession of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctors that can be traced back to the Qing Dynasty. Growing up on a garden on the outskirts of my hometown, my grandfather taught me about plants' medical properties, pulse diagnosis, and how to read ancient medical records. In college, I started to recognize that the heritage of any ancient wisdom could take advantage of the power of data science. Interested in improving certain issues of primary health care in the developing countries, I am working on a personal herbal medicine research project largely based on data science as a tool. Beyond school, I'm a dancer, composer, debate tutor, and Broadway shows lover.","As the Discovery Program offers great opportunities for students to build data science skills and provide collaborators with technical assistance, I hope I can apply the knowledge learned in class to help address real-life issues and create tangible impacts. First, I wish I can participate in a research with a good, contemporary ""social intension,"" (eg. related to policy, NGOs, or local problems) learning about how to start on, develop, process, and finalize a research project. I also would like to meet and work with people who cares about social goods. Second, I look forward to learning new, practical tools in the field of data science, including data visualization, modeling, and database creation through hands-on practice. I'm also passionate about doing work that includes research, communication or collaboration with the local community, partnership organizations, or companies. Thirdly, I hope to improve my management, problems-solving, presentation, and collaboration skills.","My teamwork very much depends on my role in the team. For leadership role, I am used to know everyone's preferences and skills beforehand, assign tasks, and have scheduled meetings to discuss progress. For member role, I'm a detail-oriented person. Individually, I prefer being clarified with my personal tasks, coming up with timeline and methods for my tasks, use visual platform to update my progress, and share with my leader and the teammates for checking and changes. Collaboratively, I would communicate with my teammates on time to make sure we are on the same page, and raise working efficiency.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"One of my lifelong goals is to become a responsible citizen to the local community. In order to be “responsible”, one not only needs to possess the mindset to care about social issues, but is also required to learn and apply technical skills to create positive impacts. Aiming to improve equity and well-being for youth locally and worldwide, Innovation for Youth inspires me by its support for the marginalized community, passion for advocacy, and an effective RP3s approach combining research and practice. After reading Ending Youth Homelessness Catalyst Group’s previous publications, I learned that homelessness experiences are diverse, which calls for consideration in a wide range of social factors, and therefore requires optimized communication, a shared platform, and broader partnerships. I think I’m able to contribute for three reasons. First, while data science major provides me with basic data analysis as well as website design skills, cognitive science teaches me to take mental factors into account when conducting any research. Last summer, I focused on the topic -“the displaced” - and learned about refugees and immigrants from historical, social, and psychological aspects, which, I think, is related to this research about marginalized and traumatized youth. Second, minoring in Global Poverty and Practice, I outreached to some local organizations that could be partnered with to both hear the voices from the needed themselves and get to know different assisting methods from other organizations. For example, the Blum Center on campus funds innovation initiatives for social goods. The Bread Project provides training, job placement assistance, and support services for impoverished individuals in Berkeley.

Aiming to transform societal perception of retirement and alternate work arrangement, WAHVE inspired me by its innovative idea, care for retiring workers, and passion for redefining business. I'm interested in participating in this project for three reasons. Firstly, this unconventional organization combines good intentions with market-based solution, which largely benefited the needed populations. Interested in micro-finance, a small loan lent to low-income individual who lack access conventional banking services, I did research and wrote a paper about small-scale market based approaches. I think Wahve shares similarities with micro-finance in assisting the needed and optimizing the current business model. As retirement issue has been a heated debate, I would like to learn about the company's ideology, developing process, and impact through my time and work. Secondly, while data science major provides me with basic data analysis as well as website design skills, cognitive science teaches me to take human mental factors into account when conducting any research. I wish to not only participate in data analysis and project the trend of seniors work patterns, but also conduct surveys on the psychological demands for post-retirement jobs in order to increase matching efficiency in the business market. Thirdly, Wahve stands out due to its unique role in the job market and its cultural impact in fighting for gender, racial, and age bias.

That is to say, I want to investigate topics further than what is superficially presented to me. 
For my major, Applied Mathematics, my primary interest is modelling numbers and data, the applications of such, and how to evaluate the model’s effectiveness. In Math 128A, for instance, I learned how calculators use various numerical estimation techniques to “calculate” the square root of 2 within a fraction of a second. Similarly, in Stats 135, I learned how to interpret a particular data set’s linear regression from the summary of its regression in R. To help me better evaluate and understand my data, I learned various programming languages such as R, Python, Matlab, and even how to navigate a Linux system so that I have more tools at my disposal to uncover processes that underlie statistical correlations.
Additionally, I’m interested in peeking behind the curtain of societies; I’m interested in learning about past and present cultures to better understand how people today interact with each other. I also want to help close inequalities that hide behind the curtain of society. Thus, I volunteer at food pantries and academic resources for marginalized folks.","Through my participation in Discovery Research, I wish to become a better data scientist. First, I want to gain experience with data science outside of a teaching environment, such as a project. Within the classroom, assignments are designed such that they clearly illustrate a particular concept and consequently, classroom assignments clearly intend for a student to use that particular concept throughout it, which is reflected in how the solutions to the assignment are straightforward. Though classroom assignments work well to teach a student the fundamentals of data science, data science problems outside the classroom don’t necessarily have a clear-cut solution, if they have a solution at all. I want to learn how to deal with these sorts of problems so that I can further exercise my skills as a data scientist and become more flexible with different kinds of situations and projects in data science. I feel that if I were to participate in Discovery Research, I can reinforce my existing knowledge of data science concepts with even more practice and gain experience with data science in more unstructured situations. Additionally, I also want the satisfaction of using the skills I have and will learn to contribute to projects that will benefit others.","In my Asian Americans and Education class, there was a major assignment involving a group of 3-4 students taking over as lecturers for the class for a day. My group’s day’s topic was the history of Asian American Studies as an academic field. Each of us have individual strengths, so I helped delegate tasks to complement each other’s strengths to so the group can work more efficiently. For example, I was the best at compiling information from a stack of readings, so my primary task was to do such. Another group member was actually an education major, so she was in charge of drafting a lesson plan. Because she already had teaching experience as an education major, in order to grow in my ability to communicate information to others I asked her for some tips in lecturing. Finally, the camaraderie we fostered during the project helped us get to know each other and deal with each other better as people. By interacting with some of my peers outside of the classroom, I got to know them better as friends. ",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"I’m interested in this project because I find that encouraging inclusive speech in spaces, rather than simply stopping hate speech, is an intriguing and important approach to maintaining inclusive spaces. Inclusiveness in cyberspace has increasingly become a hot topic, and I’m interested in helping to foster an inclusive cyberspace. Having worked with queer organizations such as QARC in the past, I understand the importance of inclusive spaces to marginalized communities, and I learned that encouraging an inclusive atmosphere in tandem with stopping hate speech shows marginalized folks that it is safe, welcomed, and encouraged for them to reach out for resources they need. With that in mind, I feel that this project makes a vital contribution to the discussion on inclusive spaces, a discussion I want to contribute to as well. I also have some experience in media analysis; in Stat 133, there was a project in which I took a list of dozens of tweets and used various R functions to gather information on the tweets, such as frequencies of words and characters, and emotions conveyed. I enjoyed that assignment and want to participate in this project since the research themes of this project are similar to the Stat 133 assignment.",Cal Alumni Association Analysis of Engaged Alumni,"I’m interested in this project because I want to help CAA better serve Cal alumni as a way for me to help give back to UC Berkeley. A few years ago, I worked at Cal Calling Center, where I fundraised over $2000 by engaging with Cal alumni, and through my interactions with alumni, I know that there is certainly room for improvement for how UC Berkeley engages with them. Cal alumni have contributed so much to this university both as students and as alumni, thus I want to help meet their needs through CAA so that  they will want to engage more with UC Berkeley through event participation and donations. Through this project, I hope to apply what I learned in UC Berkeley as a student to help improve how CAA and Cal Alumni engage with each other  to each other’s benefit. Thus, I want to participate in this project to better improve CAA engagement with alumni.",Sumerian Network Analysis,"I’m interested in this project because I’m quite interested in history and different cultures and I want to use my skills in data science to help academia gain deeper insights into each of these fronts. In particular, I enjoy learning about seemingly “mundane” aspects of historical societies, such as what everyday schedules for an average person in the past was like and how people interacted with each other. I feel that learning about everyday aspects of historical societies help inform us on how we interact with each other in the present. For example, taking SEASIAN 10B (Introduction to the Civilization of Southeast Asia) helped me understand why friend’s Filipino parents’ interact the way they do, and History 6B (Medieval to Modern Chinese History) helped me understand my own parents’ backgrounds as Chinese immigrants. I want to contribute to a body of research that helped me understand people around me and can likewise help others understand their peers.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,I have not previously applied to the Division of Data Sciences,I have not previously wokred on any Discovery Projects,None,I heard about the DIscovery Program through social media (Facebook),There is no other information,1,

I have been fortunate to be exposed to a variety of cultures and perspectives from a very young age, having lived in a number of countries across Asia and Europe. These experiences were fascinating, but also overwhelming at times as I became increasingly aware of global issues such as climate change or poverty, to name a few. As a result, I have sought to enlarge my understanding of the world by pursuing a multidisciplinary education, with courses ranging from politics, law, sociology, history, economics… and now data science, ever since I transferred to UC Berkeley. Although this interest is still rather recent, I am very enthusiastic about combining data science tools with other disciplines to solve real-world problems. I feel like this discovery research program is a good opportunity to put myself to the test and gets hands-on experience in the field. ","As a senior graduating in Spring 2020, I really want to make the most of what UC Berkeley has to offer. I feel that this program is a huge opportunity for me to get involved in a project that has a positive social impact, and work alongside professionals who are driven by a similar sense of purpose. I look forward to gaining insights from people who are experts in their field and are willing to share their experiences and knowledge. Hopefully, these will broaden my horizons and my understanding of the topic or specific issue at hand. Furthermore, I wish to develop my data science skills and put them to use in a real work environment. I am certain this experience will teach me to communicate and cooperate more effectively with my peers, which will be invaluable as I prepare to enter the job market. ","I believe that it is crucial to find an equilibrium between individual and collective responsibilities when working in a team. A good way to do that is to first brainstorm with team members on the project objectives and deadlines. This paves the way for more productive work later on, as each member can work independently on the specific task that was assigned to them. That said, team members should still cooperate with one another and most importantly make themselves available if their team needs support or advice. This leads me to another important point regarding transparency. I think it’s fine to run into an obstacle, you should just let the rest of the team know when this happens. Being honest about your progress ensures that everyone is on the same page and the final product is delivered in time.

My interests and experiences for the subject can be dated back to high school, where I joined several student organizations under tech-related roles. I was exposed to both web and app development and, seizing the inconveniences of school life as opportunities, was able to put my programming skills into works with real impacts. Upon entering college, I continued my involvement in such organizations by joining the Daily Cal, where I participated in both the development of the website and data-driven journalistic projects. The latter involves both data collection and analysis as well as showing the results in an interactive form using the web with libraries like d3.js. ","By taking part in the Discovery Research Program, I hope to bridge the gap between the academic skills I learned in class and real-life applications of data science techniques. The ability to apply and develop technical maturity through hand-on approach in edge-cuting researches truely excites me. I also find the connection with the industry and a variety of NGOs provided by the program to be invaluable for an undergraduate student. Ultimately, I hope that with its diverse and interdisciplinary array of projects, the program can enable me to explore and pursue my career goals . ","I have been working in a team-based software development environment since high school and actively participated as both team leads and members. Regardless of the role I'm taking, I find teamwork most productive when each team member feels that their ideas and positions are being respected. Thus, I always actively consider the opinions of my collaborators when working as a team. Without suggestions from my peers from the editorial team, my projects at Nirvana News and Daily Cal would never turn out to be what they are today. Yet at the same time, I believe that it is important for one to insist their own opinions when necessary in order to cultivate a truly cooperative environment.

I am still undecided about aspects of my academic career but am deeply passionate about many of them. I am a first generation daughter of two refugee parents from the soviet union, which has given me a deep passion for science but also a love of history, language, and literature. In high school, I was always interested in computer science and STEM overall, but I was also a member of the debate team for 6 years, and am hoping to start again this semester at Cal. Since getting to Berkeley, I have taken classes in computer science, data science, cognitive science, data ethics, and Russian literature. My current academic path is studying Data Science + Cognitive Science. love data science because of its interdisciplinary aspects, and I see a future in connecting multiple fields to each other, along with using the vast amount of data humanity has for good. I am interested in CogSci because I am curious about how the brain works. I am a part of Berkeley’s chapter of TAMID, which focuses on consulting for startups. Outside of academics, I am involved in the Jewish community at Berkeley. I’m an engagement fellow and student board member for Berkeley Hillel. I truly love people, and interpersonal skills feel natural for me. Most recently, I worked at a startup over the summer, working on data collection/AI to match lawyers to jobs and clients to lawyers. This gave me a very basic understanding of AI, but I hope to gain a better one through Data Discovery. I","My biggest goal is start applying my interest in data science to a real problem, while still being in a team or guided setting. I am really interested in learning and applying even the beginnings of tangible skills, specifically machine learning, natural language processing, and general analysis. I am ready to work on something hands-on, and it’s exciting for me that I have some of the basic skills from Data8 fresh in my mind, the skills from 61A under my belt, and that I’ll be taking 61B at the same time. I hope to both sit back and absorb whatever I can from the leaders of the projects, while also really taking the time out of every week to collaborate with teammates and find a solution. 
 
","I love working in teams because I consider them to be 3, 4, 5 etc brains instead of 1. This is not always a benefit for some kinds of projects, but for large quantities of data or problem solving, it is. I love to lead when I know I have the potential to guide the group somewhere interesting,but am also very comfortable being led by anyone who has more expertise. I find a unique quality is my sense of humor, and I try to bring joy and laughter to my environments. I know when to be serious, but I find fostering a closeness in a group helps with conflict solving and better results. 
",NASA data viz,"Working for/along with NASA has always been a dream, but I feel I always assumed it took only thorough software engineering or astrophysics knowledge. While I am definitely gaining software engineering knowledge, especially this semester, it is so exciting that there is more and more space for data scientists. Besides just the idea of a NASA project being exciting, I’m really curious about flight simulation as my cousin teaches this in the army. My interest in cognitive science also draws me to the project because they collect eye sensor data. I find the part of the project that attempts to find the link/behavior link between different kinds of behaviors, including the eye sensor data, to be really interesting. I hope to gain a better understanding of flight simulation as a whole, as well as a causal chain of events that can occur throughout an instance of the simulator’s use. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"At first glance, this project reminds me of a more involved version of a project I was involved with the summer before my senior year of high school. There, the lab was working on CancerBase, a form of ‘social media’ for cancer patients. The general idea, though, was that cancer disease and treatment data is often ‘silod’ away and not left open to the public or a lot of medical institutions. The point of the project, and other work I did there, was very similar to this one: improving information and access of that information for patients. The fact that the project uses project will use natural language processing (one of the skills I am most excited to learn) is already intruding, but it’s even more important that it is being used on records to see which are missing critical diagnostic information. This project carries a huge importance and meaning to it, and in my eyes that makes it incredibly fulfilling and will drive me to work on it. I have always cared about cancer research, and being able to tackle it once again from a data-driven persepctive, but this time at a higher level, is a very exciting opportunity. 
",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"As I mentioned before, I have a deep interest in languages and am excited to learn more about linguistics and its connection to fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. Going just off of the project description, I think it's really interesting to be able to extract data from acoustic files and then use machine learning techniques to extract patterns from those. I am curious to see what kind of patterns we will find and are looking for, and what kind of acoustic data we are looking at. As in most of these projects, the ability to apply introductory data science knowledge and gain machine learning techniques is most important.

Often times, many don’t realize the disparity in education across the United States. An education from a rural town is very different than an education from an urban city. As a result, some students may feel unprepared for higher education, resulting in feelings of uncertainty. I spend my time working with the EECS department to create events targeted at students who may feel they don’t belong. For example, I co-created an event called EE/CS Community Week where over 100 members of different technical organizations mentored students who had doubts about their major or their school. Additionally, I work closely with local schools to host STEM related events in an effort to inspire young students to follow their dreams. I hope to continue in the realm of education and use the skills I’ve learned at UC Berkeley to give back to the community. ","Through Discovery Research I hope to learn about real world data science applications, specifically those that help communities similar to the ones I grew up in. I was raised in a  small town in Southwest Virginia. Being one of the only female POCs, that too pursuing higher education, I wanted to set an example for students much like myself. In addition, I hope to experience first hand how the skills I learn in class help to solve the world’s biggest issues. In particular, I am very interested in projects focused on social impact because that is the sector I hope to work in after graduation. Currently, I am planning to minor in Global Poverty and Practice, focusing on using data science to create large impacts on small communities. I believe that Discover Research will allow me to utilize both my technical and nontechnical skills in order to make a difference in an individual’s life.","I am a firm believer that interpersonal relations and communication are the key factors in any good team. I believe that everyone should be treated equally and take equal initiative to contribute their ideas within a team. I am encouraging of those who may be shy to voice their opinions and seek to get feedback from everyone I am working with, even if they do so anonymously. A team is only as strong as its weakest link, so why not empower that link to grow stronger with the support of everyone on that team. In addition, open lines of communication allows the team to problem solve more effectively. There is a strong difference between a professional issue and a personal issue. Each teammate should be open to feedback from their teammates to ensure that everyone is on the same page and is working efficiently.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"My initial interest for healthcare was catalyzed by the removal of my mom’s cardiac tumor. She was diagnosed with a heart problem at a young age and has constantly been seeing different medical professionals about her heart. This made me want to use technology at a young age to help patients such as my mom. I developed a streamline process to detect and treat cancer stem cells in tumors through combining dielectrophoresis, ALDEFLOUR, and drug delivery via fiber-based neural interfaces to help minimize the overhead many doctors face. In addition, I developed an application to relay these results to patients and doctors using Swift and C++. I created a machine learning model to predict which treatment would be the most effective in eradicating varying stages of cancer stem cells. I am passionate about the intersection of technology and healthcare because I am able to help people like my mom obtain fast detection and treatment. Because of my past experience with medical research and computer science coupled with my passion for helping patients like my mom, I believe I am a strong candidate for this project. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"By 2022, the United States will need 1.7 million more engineers and computing professionals. Women — who make up more than half the population  — are still significantly underrepresented in these fields. The good news is that now more than ever before, young girls and women are interested in technical careers. Through inspiring young girls in organizations like “100 Girls of Code” and spearheading women in tech events such as the annual EECS Women in History Month, I have prioritized the empowerment of females within my STEM community. I hope to contribute my technical skills in data visualization to provide female leaders more transparency in regards to the state of women in technology. My technical experience coupled with my passion for encouraging women to pursue technical fields makes me a strong candidate for this project. ",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"Coming into Berkeley, I had been hearing buzz around environmental and social issues, especially by campus organizations dedicated to educating Cal students. After attending one of these seminars, my curiosity peaked and I decided to enroll in an ESPM course focused on breaking down these policies. As the semester progressed, I learned about how many environmental policies disproportionately affect minority groups. I became more and more involved through volunteering with local organizations and even went as far as dedicating my final project to combining my skills in technology with my newfound passion for educating my peers. I created a website which educated my peers on many of these policies and created visualizations which demonstrated much of impact these policies have on minority groups juxtaposed with the average American. This inspired me to pursue a minor in Global Poverty and Practice as I continue to use data science to develop new techniques in educating my peers on the issues at hand and more importantly, how they can involved. Because of my passion for using technology to empower groups who do not have the means to speak for themselves, I believe I am a strong candidate for this project.

I have taken Data 8, CS 88, CS61A, and CS61B in the past semesters, and I wish to apply the skills I have acquired to tackle problems in the real world. I also want to explore the numerous applications of data science. Most of all, I’m excited to meet people from different backgrounds who can challenge me and show me different viewpoints and techniques I would not usually consider. Through participation in Discovery Research, I believe I can gain invaluable experience and inspiration from colleagues and professors. I will have the opportunity to work with passionate people who have the same interests as me and together we can begin making an impact. Since the world is constantly changing and evolving, research is a sole component of solving issues in society and gaining more knowledge of the data around us. ","My approach to teamwork involves dividing up tasks based on everyone’s specific skillsets. This creates a methodic approach when tackling a problem, and allows everyone’s strong suits to shine. I also believe the most important part of teamwork is consistent communication. Since people in the team are assigned different roles, it is vital that everyone is expressing their ideas as well as providing updates and asking questions. My approach to teamwork also involves holding each person in the team accountable. I believe everyone in the team should be dedicated to their tasks and be able to meet the deadlines set. If people in the team don’t feel accountable, often times the task assigned will not be completed properly and other people will have to make up the work someone else slacked off on. In summary, the best way to approach teamwork is to clarify the purpose of the project, divide roles accordingly, communicate frequently, and ensure every member of the team is committed to the project.  ",Campus Database for Student Experiential Learning Opportunities,"I want to participate in this project because I want to be involved in a project that helps students at Cal. As a student, it is difficult to keep track of all the opportunities available to us, as well as find opportunities that we are interested in and meet the requirements for. I would love to develop an organized platform with an improved UI to help students keep track of upcoming deadlines as well as narrow down learning opportunities based on keywords and interests. I also have two years of web design experience that I could contribute to this project. This project is the perfect way to be more involved in Berkeley and help match people to specific opportunities. ",Data Enabled Donations,"I want to be involved in this opportunity because it is an impactful project that helps people in need during disasters. I’m interested in using my data/computer science background to create new data-driven techniques to classify and redistribute resources to help the disaster relief process. Since we have to be organized and work efficiently during times of need, it is vital to figure out a way to give shelters the supplies they need in the shortest amount of time.",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I’m interested in this project because I want to help bridge the gap between men and women in tech and also quantify the participation of women across various STEM majors. On-campus, I’m involved in many organizations supporting women in tech including CS kickstart, CS scholars, and Society of Women in EECS (SWE). We know these issues are prevalent in our society, and I would love to do further research to address and learn more about the state of women in tech.

With so many avenues to access information and learning I find myself currently juggling studying for CS classes, playing classical piano, broadening my horizons through literature, and other activities as well. Outside of the classroom, I have been a part of the Berkeley food pantry team, the Computer Science Mentors program, and the Net Impact Berkeley management consulting group which focuses on areas of social impact.  ","As someone that has always been interested ways to drive a positive impact, Discovery Research is an attractive opportunity due to the fact that many of the projects combine Data with social good. As someone that has relatively recently gotten involved with working with Data, I believe that working on a project with tangible social good would not only be incredibly fulfilling, but would also add a very important element of engagement.","There are several important factors that contribute to being an effective member of a team. I personally believe that effective collaboration begins with coming from a place of humility. Having ideas and voicing them is incredibly important, but I also understand the necessity of others within the iterative process. Whether it's conflicting solutions to a problem or receiving feedback, I believe that humility and empathy go a long way to creating a successful environment. I also believe that leading by example and integrity are core to the ways I function within a team. I always make an effort to extend help to others. Diligence and timely completion of work are also core to keeping deadlines on track to be met.",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"For many years I had a great interest in constitutional law, and the politics surrounding the supreme court have always been fascinating to me. I think this project particularly raises some very important questions. With a clearly partisan court in power, I think that there has been a lot of focus on the decisions being made as opposed to which cases get chosen at all. I believe that it could be a very impactful project that combines many of my separate passions.",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"One of the areas I've grown progressively more interested in over my time in college has been food access. After having volunteered at Berkeley's food pantry over several semesters, I have seen how variant community members access to food is. I think this project is particularly interesting because it seems to address the underlying reason for why we have unequal institutions when it comes to food systems as opposed to focusing on alleviating the symptoms.

I spent an entire year after graduating high school to explore and deepen my blended cultural identity and career interest in data science. Throughout that year, I mentored an inner-city high school robotics team, volunteered as a data analyst for a non-profit in rural Indonesia, worked as a product analytics intern for a Silicon Valley tech company, and taught English in southwestern China. My experiences have provided me the ability to understand two communities of polar opposites: the booming tech industry driving the world forwards and the hard-working organizations keeping the underprivileged from falling behind. 

By analyzing the similarities and differences between such disconnected people, I have developed a socially unique perspective: one that pushes my technological ambitions, but still aims to remember those in need. My goal in college is to learn the technical skills that 
could help me learn, implement and adapt to various industries of service-related work, whether it is in education, city planning, or smart technologies. ","To me, data science is not so much a set of skills or particular strategy. Instead, it is a mindset and way of thinking that could be applied to any field or industry, and with increasing relevance as the world advances in technology. This is the reason why I have wanted to study data science ever since my junior year of high school. The variety of Discovery Research projects and collaboration with other fields and departments (Digital Humanities, Sociology, Energy Resources, etc.) further affirm my fascination with how applicable such a data-driven mindset is in every facet of the world. Being given an opportunity to do research in data science with a diverse group of people excites me immensely. 

Additionally, I want to do work in data science that visibly impacts a group of people. In many situations, data science is the most effective way to detect a problem, innovate a solution, and record its effectiveness while continuously improving the solution. It would be incredibly educational and rewarding to practice this lifecycle in its entirety and know the type of people who would benefit from such research. 
","To me, the most essential qualities of a good team member is communication, awareness and empathy. Whenever I am in a team environment, I try my best to make sure that everyone feels involved and recognized by keeping these traits in mind. Communication is important because productivity is maximized when everyone is on the same page and completely honest about their progress. Personally, I try to uphold myself to a 24-hour response time policy on all my team projects, and have enforced it as a leader of my organization Data Science Society at Berkeley. Awareness and empathy are important attributes that I have improved over time with past experiences in team situations such as class group work, consulting/project teams, and event/organization planning. It is crucial to be able to notice the emotions of my team members on the fly (without hovering), whether it is a hesitation to participate, a loss in motivation, or feeling of disappointment. This way, I can properly adapt to my team members and try to help out where I can. With these qualities, I hope to be able to work with any person, no matter their past experience or domain of work. 
",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"I have personally attended a presentation on a project analyzing Reddit toxicity, and much of the crowd (as well as presenters) just chuckled at a lot of the findings. In the end, they proposed an improved filter system for the platform (but then again it is… Reddit), and I thought to myself, “there must be more to this”. Upon reading about this research project to “make cyberspace inclusive”, it has filled in the blank thought I had about what should instead be done with NLP analytics in social media. 

Figuring out a way to identify the notion of people exchanging ideas inclusively is very positive, but very challenging task. What does it really mean to be inclusive? Because it surely isn’t just a couple of positive words. Social media is a very scary place for much of the world, but the amount of data that comes with all these platforms (though Quora is an example of social media aimed towards helping others; a good starting place) also allows us to use data science to make it more friendly. Joining this team and brightening the good in social media would be an incredible opportunity for me to learn and improve our society as we know it. ",Wahve,"I absolutely love the mission that Wahve presents. Companies and hiring managers are always looking to recruit the youngest yet still most experienced talent readily available to them, and seniors find it especially difficult to find work. These “pretiring” seniors are highly experienced and skilled, but many companies immediately overlook this in pursuit of the group of people they perceive as more “up to date” of the knowledge required for their roles. I think that it is genius of Wahve to take advantage of the way companies utilize remote workflows and online collaboration to benefit seniors still looking to be apart of the workforce. I would be really excited to work on the research team dedicated to seeing how seniors perform as such independent contractors, and hope to propose to data-driven solutions that would improve the Brainwahve Qualifying Solution’s effectiveness with working seniors. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I have been in public inner-city schooling all my life where there were students and teachers from all walks of life. As a student part of the Pittsburgh Public Schools system (which has been apart of countless documentaries about public education), I have recognized first-hand the enormous achievement gap between kids with different ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses. My schools were separated based on kids with honors and without from 6th to 12th grade, and there was a very clear difference. 

Now with my experience in data science, I have come to realize how impactful data is both identifying public school problems and solutions. There are a multitude of reasons I can think purely based on my experiences that may contribute to such an achievement gap, whether it is attendance due to family problems to home neighborhood distance from better schools. My friends have missed school because of divorced parents and/or parents in jail. My friends and I have taken 1+ hour long public bus rides just to get to/from school. I am excited that my knowledge in data science and public schooling can be well-utilized to help this research project and discover the factors that play towards this achievement gap. It would be extremely rewarding to find data-driven solutions and create policy to solve problems that I have personally experienced.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,"Through my organization, Data Science Society at Berkeley",Super excited to partake in research at Berkeley!,1,

I'm a freshman from a town near Princeton, New Jersey. Growing up, I always loved playing and watching sports. During high school, I spent a majority of my time playing on the  Varsity Basketball team. I love that basketball can bring out my competitiveness and push me to work harder and to overcome failures. Another big part of me is that I'm a Christian. I love going to church, conferences, and Bible summer schools. I've learned how to help by serving others through teaching children's bible classes and playing piano for Sunday service. Sports and religion, although immensely different have pushed my academic interests. My dream job would be to be a sports data analytic for a professional team. Realistically however, I want to work with data to help others have better lives. ","Ultimately, I want to have an experience where I learn a lot of knowledge from mentors and I also learn how to collaborate and solve problems with peers. I'm driven solely by the desire to learn more information and gain important research techniques. Hopefully, I also work on a project with an end result being that I can say that I had a positive impact on our society. ","Playing a team sport my whole life, I've learned how to be a part of a team and how to be a good teammate. The most important thing is to be selfish. My coach would always harp on ""we before me"". For a research project, the team's interests are the first priority. I must consciously think about what is best for the group, rather than was is just what is convenient for me. Thus, teams require compromise to be successful. I need to be flexible, open minded, and willing to listen to others. I must be willing to adapt and get out of my comfort zone to work with others. The other big thing is that I must be reliable. There needs to be an atmosphere of trust for teamwork to happen. I need to be responsible and accountable with getting work done accurately and timely. When everyone is communicating well and is on the same page, great teamwork can be achieved.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"This project harmoniously combines my two interests: CS and economics. Working on this project would allow me to apply my prior knowledge with python and macro and micro economics, but more importantly, I would gain more practical skills. Additionally, the political, social and financial implications of drugs, especially with the cannabis industry, greatly interests me. I even took a course last semester called Drugs and the Brain, which delved into these topics. I feel like this project could have a great impact on my generation and also the future generations as cannabis becomes more widely accepted in society.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"When I first became interested in data science, I marveled at the many applications to physics, finance, sports, etc. However, I was most impressed with biology and medical applications. I talked to a professor from Washington State and it boggled my mind how his projects could be so fun, interesting, but so important to society, especially sick patients that are in dire need of help. Although I will be no doctor, I would feel so accomplished if my work with technology can also have a profound impact on people's lives. Personally, this project would mean a lot to me because my family has a history with heart disease. I would feel so proud knowing that I could create difference from the future generations of my family.",Automated Water Purification,"I was instantly interested because of the possibility of making an app. In high school, I only would try to make silly, simple gaming apps, but through this project, I could feel accomplished by making an app that greatly help our society.

Today, at Berkeley I plan on studying Computer Science and Data Science. Given my unique background, I have been surrounded by a variety of people in my lifetime and this has given me perspective and allowed me to truly recognize my privilege. I have been raised to create a seat at the table for myself, and to do whatever is in my power to allow others the same opportunity for themselves. As a result of this upbringing, my fascination with technology sparks from the limitless opportunities there are to help all kinds of communities, from helping a disabled person walk to analyzing data to understand what might cause a heart attack. Outside of academics I enjoy exploring new places and meeting new people. I am fond of cooking and reading as a means of unwinding!
"," I am driven by the thought of enhancing the lives of others through the use of technology and am confident that being apart of Discovery Research will help me gain the guidance, support and knowledge I need to be one step closer to achieving this goal. I hope that Discovery Research will allow me to interact with like minded people from whom I can learn and discuss relevant issues and potential solutions. In addition, I hope to learn from a different lens and grasp concepts in a new way, expanding my mind to its potential. I am excited to obtain mentors and support in this vast field and am confident that being a part of such a dedicated community of people and project I will be able to achieve this. ","I am a firm believer that to truly achieve the most effective solution to any problem, collaboration is a necessity. I believe that coming together to discuss differences in ideas and opinions allows for the most open discussions and thus leads to the most impactful and relevant solutions. Independant thinking is incredibly important, however, unless there are people to debate thoughts and ideas with, many of those ideas won't reach their full potential when executed. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"Growing up in Mexico City and often traveling back to India, I was always exposed to the reality of homelessness. People's difficult circumstances was always something I was aware of but I never really had any power to truly make an impact regarding their lifestyle. 

Often times, I think such major issues in our society become normalized and we as a society begin to focus on much less pressing issues. However, it is evident that being involved in a project such as this one will allow for longterm impact and will form a support system for the struggling youth. Understanding and examining violence prevention through this project has the potential of having a direct impact on the lives of others and to be a part of this change not only solves so many already existing problems but it opens doors to exploring other issues impacting these communities as well. I look forward to learning from people who have the same aspirations and motivations regarding the use of technology; I hope to use this opportunity to expand my knowledge and my vision for using data as a means of social impact. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"The intersection between technology and healthcare is an incredibly interesting and effective way to understand the diseases that kill millions every day. Coming from a family with a history of heart disease, I am specifically drawn by this project. The power of data fascinates me and the fact that it can be used to possibly catch and prevent diseases that cause so much pain and suffering to the lives of others is incredibly exciting. I have always appreciated the functionality of the human body; how every organ operates so eloquently and how they all come together to form this system that runs our whole lives. The same way, I am intrigued by technology and all its advancements in regards to training data and understanding patterns to predict these diseases. Through my families personal experience, it is evident that if there was some way to have known sooner about cardiovascular disease, then the outcome would have been incredibly different. Motivated by the thought of having a direct impact on the lives of others, I am confident that this project is the way to tackle such a major healthcare issue and I am excited to be a part of it. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I come from a household where my mother got married off at 23; she was told to quit her job and become a homemaker all because that's what society expected of her. My parents moved from India to Mexico City and had me, in the hope that I would have the opportunity to find the courage and support to pursue my interests. 

I consider myself privileged to have seen what my mother went through and still have the opportunity to change all this for myself and for the women around me. As a result, projects such as this one really grab my attention. I am motivated to channel my frustration that roots from confined societal expectations into my drive to empower other women and to spread awareness about STEM fields. Getting involved and understanding the state of women in tech is such an important part of truly understanding where specifically women need the most support. I am confident that conducting research and working with the data we already have about women in STEM fields, we will be able to tackle this issue on a grander scale. The challenge for women to own their spot in male dominated fields is immense, but I am determined to use the technology and resources that we are so fortunate to have, to make the most impact where it is most needed.

While I thoroughly enjoyed the classes I took related to fields of engineering, I realized that it wasn’t something I was truly passionate about. After exploring through summer camps and doing personal research, I found a passion in an area that utilizes the technical background that I grew up around, particularly in the realm of business. Data science is a great fit for me, since it is based on technical/STEM concepts but is a subject that crosses disciplinary boundaries and is highly applicable to various fields. 

Beyond academics, I enjoy engaging with unique individuals. The interactions I’ve had with others through service - whether it be the impoverished elementary kids I taught financial literacy lessons to or the elderly I have met through a club that I started - have truly impacted me. Performing music to others and simply exploring new genres has also played a big role in my mental health and the friendships I have developed. Some other hobbies of mine include traveling and capturing memories with the people I love through photography and video editing!","I hope to broaden my understanding of data science and its applications, gain meaningful research experience, and make a real impact through a project I am passionate about. 

While I am greatly intrigued by data science and how it is multidisciplinary in nature, I have yet to apply my technical knowledge to a real-life project. I am eager to use the computer science knowledge I’ve acquired and my strong math/analytical skills to learn how data science is applied to help solve relevant issues. I am quite new to research; I believe the mentorship, training, and experience I can get will greatly help me acquire the skills I need to succeed professionally in the future. I am particularly excited by the vast array of projects to choose from, and there are several that spark my interest and get me thinking. I am eager to use my technical skills to create something innovative that can help those around us. 

Overall, participating in Discovery Research will allow me to take part in an invaluable research experience and delve deep into the fascinating world of data science. 
","When put in a team setting, I am a combination of both a bold leader and an active listener. I often have ideas formulating quickly inside my head if I’m presented with a new task; I am eager to present my ideas to others. However, I actively seek feedback and greatly value the diverse opinions of my teammates, whether they support my idea or not. I enjoy hearing the different takes people may have on an idea and know when to sit back and listen, and I’m fascinated by the unique ideas others come up with that may not have crossed my mind before. From working as a team with my closest friends to being the youngest and least experienced on an officer team, I have learned that effective communication and compromise are key to success in a team setting. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"This is my first choice project since it combines both data science and business concepts. I am intrigued by financial markets and the fluctuations that happen within them; I actually spent my first semester here at Berkeley exploring trends in industries and large companies as a part of my finance committee curriculum (through Future Business Leaders of America - Phi Beta Lambda). The opportunity to apply my coding skills to better understand the trends occurring in a large-scale industry seems perfect for me. This project genuinely excites me on both ends. I am eager to broaden my technical knowledge by using Python, a language I have programming experience in, to classify data sets and and organize them to find patterns. On the other hand, I am also excited to see the results and better understand the dynamics of the cannabis industry - especially how different political, cultural, and economic elements can affect it. Every aspect of this project excites me, and I know that it is one that will keep me thinking and immersed into research. ",Kiwibot delivery robots,"This is my second choice project since it includes working with a client in the customer service industry and dealing with client satisfaction. I previously worked as a team member at Chick-fil-A one summer. Not only did I learn how to communicate with different types of people and how to work quickly under pressure, but I also learned a lot about the significance of customer service. I observed many interesting demographic trends regarding the customers that came to Chick-fil-A. Those who came in the morning were often older and more patient, while those who came during the lunch rush hour tended to be more impatient and prioritized fast service. I understand that these trends are important to the overall success of a company; using data to estimate delivery time for Kiwibot customers seems like an excellent way for me to apply my data science knowledge into the realm of service. Moreover, I love how Kiwibot is relevant to the UC Berkeley campus; it is truly exciting to think that the research we develop can potentially help the company gain better client satisfaction ratings and improved overall profitability. ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"This is my third choice project since it includes the application of data in the realm of finance. Last semester I was a part of the PBL finance committee (for Future Business Leaders of America - Phi Beta Lambda); my responsibilities as a finance analyst included keeping track of market trends, researching stocks, and much more. Finance is a distribution of business that I am interested in; conducting research in this field seems like a perfect fit for me. Data streaming is not something I am particularly familiar with, so I am excited to learn something new and better understand it through financial applications.

Over the past three semesters, I taken numerous economics and finance courses both in and out of Berkeley to learn more about the field. I recently landed an internship at an investment bank in the finance division working on internal tools to help allocate funds between teams. I'm currently enrolled in an online Machine Learning for Trading course in an effort to combine my interest in finance with my passion for data science.

I'm also deeply interested in sports, especially basketball and football. Over the past 10 years, I've been amazed to see the larger and larger reliance of data science to make roster decisions. I hope to soon be involved in sports analytics as well.

Lastly, I'm deeply vested in the entertainment industry. Living in SoCal for all of my life, I'm enamored by every step of the movie-making process and love debating, analyzing, and following performances, films, and entertainers.","I'm drawn to the Discovery Research program because of the fact that it's an interdisciplinary program that will allow me to combine multiple interests into one project. I hope to get mentorship from either a faculty member or a grad student where I can not only apply my existing skills, but also gain new knowledge. I believe that I've finally reached a point in my college career where I can get involved in research and help contribute to the forefront of academia.

I'm interested because I appreciate that the Discovery Research program has ties to industry. The impact research is often cast aside, making it more difficult to appreciate your work. By collaborating with members of industry, you can see the impact you have on the broader community and appreciate that your work has helped spark change.

Lastly, I hope to learn about fields that I'm not personally involved with. One of the great aspects about data science is that it can meaningfully be linked to different industries. Even though I won't be participating in the various fields, simply having exposure to them will go a long way in serving as an eye-opening experience.","I've always believed that a collaborative environment is the best environment. One of the benefits of being collaborative is that everyone is able to learn from every other team member. This increases everyone's understanding of the project and goes a long way in helping the team work efficiently. Furthermore, by fostering this level of openness, this encourages every team member to ask questions when they run into issues with their work. 

Nonetheless, I also believe that structure is crucial to a well-functioning team. Having more knowledgeable members serve as seniors to make executive decisions can help the team avoid pitfalls and wasting time, effort, and resources.

While I prefer to work in a team setting, I've also worked alone for various projects, most notably, my internship project. I didn't find this to be an issue and often sought help from the few resources provided to me to learn quickly.",NASA data viz,"I believe that my background fits perfectly for this project. This past summer, I built two data visualization applications for internal use at VMware. I used Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to automate data extraction and present the information.

I have experience in customer service, mentorship, advocacy and continuously give back to my community with volunteer service in local hospitals, shelters, and rural areas abroad. Currently, I am interested in pursuing a career in healthcare and biotech and am searching for opportunities that will give me the skills necessary to be an effective leader in my field. I hope to work in Data Analytics again this summer as an intern, and I hope the Data Science Discovery Program can further prepare me for this role. 
Outside of my academic and social justice pursuits, I am involved in Taiwanese American and international politics and relations. As a 1.5 generation immigrant, I have seen how important it is to maintain representation and identity. I have helped spearhead the current #WriteinTaiwanese 2020 Census Campaign. ","Even though I have had experience in Data Science in the Data 8 course, I still have a lot to learn. I am interested in applying data in the fields of health and policy. The past summer, I interned at the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and had the opportunity to use my limited data analytics knowledge from Data 8 and self-taught myself pandas as well as a little bit of R to create data visualizations od Dengue Fever a disease that put the National Health System in Taiwan at Code Yellow for the summer. This summer, I plan to continue expanding on my interest in Data Analytics; however, I hope that I can be exposed to a wider range of uses of data analytics as well as gain more techniques and thought processes to tackle each unique challenge that may be presented. I hope to be an enthusiastic and engaging undergraduate researcher when I work on the Data Science Discovery Research Program Projects. ","The approach I have to teamwork is very goal-oriented and collaborative. To begin a project, clear expectations of the mission/vision should be set, as well as expectations that each member of the team has with each other. Having these fundamentals communicated can forestall future potential disagreements or disconnect. I also believe that for a team to be efficient and motivated, each member should have an equal voice and have their ideas considered without judgment. In this mather, everyone believes that they have made a positive contribution to any project that they may be working on, tying personal investment in the work. Team members should always be encouraged to voice any creative, new, or ""impossible"" ideas because this is the catalyst for innovative solutions. In an ideal team, every member respects one another recognizes their own strengths and weaknesses as well as the organization's overall strengths and weakness and is able to manipulate and optimize these varying skillsets to work for towards the end goal. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"As the Street Outreach Coordinator of the Suitcase Clinic, a weekly clinic/safe space/community that services houseless individuals in the Berkeley and Oakland area, the topic of youth homelessness is close to my heart. Having conversed and created many friendships with youth that struggle with homelessness here in the area, I have had the unique and deeply saddening opportunity to see a small sliver of the challenges that being a houseless youth manifests. I am interested to use data conversion, analysis, as well as the many other forms of studying data, to create accessible databases to inform policymakers, researchers, and social service providers toward violence prevention efforts for young people experiencing homelessness. As a member of the Suitcase Clinic, our daily efforts are not enough. They are just a bandaid solution. Policy changes and advocacy/education are steps that can be taken to  change the system as a whole. ",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,Having previous exposure to the medical field as a research intern in a proteomics lab in the National Taiwan University Hospital and as a medical assistant at a startup Neurology Clinic this winter I have had the unique opportunity to see the workings and motives of various disciples of medicine. It is to the advantage of the pharmaceuticals to blatantly ignore the possibilities of analyzing raw clinical data to determine the best treatment for Chron's disease. Therefore it is up to those who are willing to take what is available with the patient's interest in mind and push for the discovery of the best and most effective treatment for this debilitating disease. ,The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"As a Global Poverty and Practice minor, I plan to do my practice experience at a local law center that works with houselessness, specifically. Public Policy as relating to health policies are of great interest and importance to me. Working on this question gives me the opportunity to explore the significance of data in analyzing important policy issues. The question of how the Supreme Court chooses the cases that they do is extremely significant. The cases that are reviewed dictates the social, political, and economic climate and discussion of the time. Using data analysis to uncover the potential methodology in the approach and decision between ""important"" and ""unimportant"" can be vital knowledge for policymakers and advocates.

I managed my family's bills ever since I learned English, so I grew accustomed to responsibility from a very young age. Through intense work and determination, I was able to excel at my high school and pursue higher education at my dream university. Ever since middle school, I was determined to continue programming, and because of this, I shadowed many technological firms and competed in numerous competitions for programming and architecture. Near the end of my sophomore year, however, I was juggling three different fields: medicine, law, and engineering. I could not decide between them because I was passionate about each topic, so I ended up taking three PLTW courses for engineering and BioMed. I was a leading attorney for my Mock Trial team, and last year, we landed regional champions for our county. One thing that has resonated with me over the years is my uncontrollable passion for volunteering. I created my organization for the homeless, which spread across the world with over 2000 members in the USA, China, and Russia. I continued volunteering here at Berkeley with clubs like Circle K, MRI, and PSC.","With this indecisive mindset, I continued my education at UCB, and I found myself overwhelmed with the variety of majors offered here. Even though the variation of classes is more significant than in high school, I finally decided that I want to pursue a combination of data science and neurobiology. I landed on the waitlist for Data 8 twice already. However, I do not want to waste my time waiting for a spot in this class while instead I can wait and exploring this phenomenal field. Participation in Discovery Research can significantly impact my opportunity in the area and enhance my skills. It is not just another door of opportunities, but it can majorly shift my future into the direction I want to pursue. I was enchanted with the number of research projects offered because I can truly become useful in the research I am passionate about. Participation in this program can and will let me take the initiative in this field and allow me to play an essential role in giving back to my community. ","Through my previous leadership experience, I was able to learn and witness the beauty of teamwork. I never understood the saying, ""Team Work Makes the Dream Work,"" until I relied on my teammates to reach the final solution. My engineering group was fortunate enough to get an internship, which required us to assist in the professor's research by writing a program through python. Python was an unfamiliar language for all of us, and only together were we able to compile an extensive plan. Our strengths varied, so this way, some of us were inclined to lead or solve mathematical calculations. As the delegated leader, I thought it was my responsibility to teach everyone, but only then I realized each individual could put in the effort and achieve success. When I work in teams, I attempt to bring in the positivity to energize the team dynamic and engage the members to enjoy the process. I weight individuals' strengths and weaknesses so each person can feel comfortable in their job. I set clear expectations to finish all the deadlines successfully but also to guarantee personal freedom in the workspace is respected. I enjoy working in a team because this way, we can all be there for each other through hot and cold. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"As I previously mentioned, I started an organization dedicated to fighting homelessness in three different countries. Immediately, this research captured my attention because the topic of homelessness and youth violence had been on my mind for a prolonged period. While many cases I dealt with were primarily for adults, I had some experience and communication with the homeless youth in my area. I come from a poor background, and through my organization, I possess a significant amount of information concerning the safety and resources. I have hands-on experience in this field.
Additionally, through an undergraduate research program called ULab, I was able to work with diverse datasets for our project. We worked with the data and tested its significance and accuracy for our extension paper. I am interested in this project because it can allow me to build a stronger understanding of databases and gain a more profound knowledge of this issue. But most importantly, this research touched my heart, and I would be able to know that I contributed to the problem that I am passionate about. 
",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"In the past two years, I lost two close friends. One of which was due to a doctor's mistake and second, because my friend did not trust the doctor with her life, therefore, she preferred to battle on her own. Both of them struggled with cardiovascular disease. As I reflect upon those tragedies, on each occasion, the same problem emerges in my mind - the health system. I understand that realistically death is unavoidable. However, I also believe with the technology we have today, we can minimize the amount of loss this world has similar diseases. I am interested in this project because I want to eradicate or at least soften the effects and consequences of this disease. I want to expand my knowledge and change at least one life in a different, positive direction. I am also intrigued by learning in-depth about electrocardiograms since I will need this knowledge in my future career. 
",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"The judicial branch had a profound impact on me because I was always astonished at the effect it has in this country. I know most of the cases by heart, and I closely follow the news about the Supreme Court. I was always fascinated by how out of 7,000 cases each year, the Supreme Court decides to hear around 100. The question this topic proposed sparked my attention because while the leading decision varies on the importance of a case, I wonder what are some secret requirements a case possesses to become extraordinary? I believe that my knowledge in data science and research analysis could benefit significantly from this program, mainly because I am involved in politics. A recent debate about creating term limitations for the Justices could hint how the importance is not determined therefore, decreasing the amount of outputs needed to analyze.

My mom was an after-school director and my dad was a tutor. To an extent, I'm still interested in education, but not in the same way, because I've grown out of wanting to become a teacher after a realized I was way more attuned to STEM. I always did well in Math being placed in the advanced class in middle school. However, in high school, I realized that while I was good at math and science, I found it less interesting than my literature classes. In addition, I loved watching movies and reading stories more than programming. The caveat was that I was never as good at writing as I was coding, and there was a lot of pressure from my parents to pursue STEM since it paid better. Ultimately, I was swayed from going down the humanities path after my dad nearly had a heart attack. Along with his deteriorating mental health, he was forced to work from home and that is when I realized how important money is to pursuing a healthy and happy life. While my dad is physically healthier now, I believe he is unfit to take care of my mom once she gets old which is a big motivation for me to be successful. I also realized along the way that making a career out of your hobbies isn't always the best idea since it'll often reduce your enjoyment of what used to be your recreational activities. That is why I choose to be in clubs like Model UN: to satisfy that itch do things other than STEM such as politics. I've also reconciled my desire to be creative with computer science since I realized that while taking classes doesn't leave a lot of room for creativity, working on your own projects does. As a side note, while I no longer desire to be a teach as I did when I was a kid, I realized that educational technology is a potential way to satisfy that need in the future while also being in line with my current career path. Finally, data analysis is ultimately also a means to find solutions to real world problems and I believe that is just as good of an outlet for creativity to me as any other.","My hope for participating in Discovery Research is to get my foot in the door for data science research. I strive to be a well-rounded individual which is why for the past 3 semesters I have mostly focused on joining organizations unrelated to my major. However, I do feel like I should spend more time on STEM-related endeavors since that is what is relevant to my major. I would like to do data science related research since I will soon be taking AI and Machine Learning courses and would like to be more versed on the subject. In addition, I have decided to take on an Economics major in addition to Computer Science because I realized that I enjoy Economics a lot since it involves statistics and data analysis. As such, I would greatly enjoy applying myself in research of that kind. One thing I am ambivalent toward in the CS/Data Science major is that most people who graduate in that major tend to gravitate toward big tech companies since it pays well. However, big tech is often involved in a lot of controversy such as selling user data. For that reason, I would rather that not be my only option which is why I want to branch out into research. I believe Discovery Research will help me in achieving that goal.","My approach to teamwork is to start by being the first person to put work into a whatever project my group is working on. That ensures that people understand that you are committed to the group and you're not trying to freeload off of other people's work. However, there needs to be a bit of moderation since your ultimate goal is to get everyone to put in their fair share of work. Of course, if you are talented and hardworking enough, it's possible for you, with maybe some slight help, to do the project all on your own. However, that isn't teamwork, and people who do everything on their own come off as controlling. In addition, people who do everything themselves are bound to burn themselves out. The key is to show your dedication by being punctual and doing your fair share, but to also distribute the work among your teammates. Once your colleagues see that you're hard working, they will often be inspired to work as hard as you do, which is when you should make room for them rather than hogging it all by yourself.",Computational Analysis of Charter School Identities and Stratification,"This project interests me because I've always wanted to know more out of aspect of education, namely what explains the various discrepancies between various groups. A lot of people would like you to believe that it's only the lazy or unintelligent that don't succeed while others argue that various social factors are the cause. I believe doing research in this project would further my understanding of the subject which is why it is my first choice.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"Overall, I would say I am a very optimistic person and surprisingly happy given the environment at Berkeley with how competitive it is. As a result, I take interests in projects that encourages positive behavior rather than simply discouraging negative behavior. After all, not being exclusive doesn't necessarily equate to being inclusive since inclusion is a lot more subtle than simply not being explicitly exclusive. I like the idea of this project in particular since its aim is to increase positive behavior rather than just decrease negative behavior.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I have had experience with heart disease since my dad has been dealing with heart problems for a long time now. He was once hospitalized for a month and had to do surgery since he almost had a heart attack. Since this topic is so involved in my life, I've developed a lot of interest towards it.

These different fields that I have pursued most recently are business, data science, dance, and international relations. I have been dancing ballet and contemporary (as well as tap and jazz at some point) for thirteen years and not only do I dance as an outlet but also to discover my limits and to push myself. The challenge of picking up choreography quickly is thrilling and I find that quick-thinking has helped me pick up instructions faster in school as well. I’m also really passionate about Model United Nations and discovered my interest in policy after directing committees for high school delegates. After taking Data8, I learned about technical applications to law and policy and am currently interested in the intersection of technology/programming with law to streamline current legal processes.","Through participating in Discovery Research, I hope to take a deep dive in this interest of mine: data science applications to legal processes. I hope to strengthen my programming skills through researching an interesting topic that has real world applications. Finally, I hope to gain a new perspective on the way I see policy and view problems whether it be in business or law. In my experience so far I have found that a “programming mindset” is one that breaks down an issue into smaller and smaller subsections, until each can be addressed individually. Ultimately, this process leads to addressing the larger issue at hand. I find this way of thinking especially applicable to my career and I hope to expand on this through Discovery Research.","Teamwork is most successful when everyone in the team is treated as an equal and all ideas are validated, supported, though also challenged by one another. In a team, I like to create an inclusive environment in which every individual feels compelled to share their input because they feel they add value to the team. I first like to work with a team to establish individual and shared goals, then construct a pathway of how we will go about reaching those goals.

My parents, both coming from immigrant families, found success working in the venture and technology industry, which had influenced me to become involved in variety of different businesses such as technology and finance. Over the past few summers, I worked in the Bay Area at several technology focused startups and have witnessed their growth at all different levels. I learned how to lead my own research and how great companies use teamwork to achieve a common goal. 

Last summer, I worked at Tubi, the largest free movie and television video on demand platform, as a content performance intern. For one of my intern projects at Tubi, I took an initiative to start a research project to uncover trends with Internet Movie Database (IMDB) information and viewer data. My final conclusion not only impacted the current curation of our content, but also showed the company how to position themselves by focusing on a specific cohort of content that appealed to the broadest audience. 

Outside of school, I enjoy skiing, reading entrepreneur biographies and cheering on the Washington Wizards.","My main intention behind participating in Discover Research is to gain formal research experience and to dedicate my last semester at Berkeley towards a meaningful project. I wish to work with a program solving relevant issues and to work with a smart team that will teach me on applications of data science. I hope this program will help me develop my critical thinking and data science skills to be able to apply what I learned throughout my four years at Berkeley to create a positive impact towards real world problems. Finally, I wish to become involved in a community of fellow data scientists with similar academic interests. I hope this research program and one-unit leadership class will help me develop life-long relationships with industry professionals and gain insight into how institutions approach research. ","Over the past few summers interning in the Bay Area and through team projects at Berkeley, I learned the importance teamwork. I believe the best approach to teamwork is built up of a few aspects: always listen, keep an open mind, and maintain a positive attitude. First, in my experience, listening to what others have to say is necessary for teammates to bring out the best in one another. I believe every team member has unique strengths and ideas that can only be brought out through listening to one other. This enables a project and team to reach its full potential. Secondly, keeping an open mind to new approaches is a key factor for maintaining a strong collaboration with one another. I believe an open approach to solving a problem makes for the best and smartest possible outcome because all options have been explored. Finally, approaching a team with a positive attitude is necessary for a project’s success. Not only does it make a team closer, but makes the team process a lot more enjoyable, thus enabling people to work harder and smarter for one another.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"My family has a history of heart disease, so this is an issue I am personally passionate about getting involved in because it has impacted my life directly. In my last semester, I am hopeful to gain research experience in the life science industry and learn how medical institutions approach heart disease. I believe this project would challenge me to use all my past work experience and academic knowledge to improve the classification of heart disease. I am ultimately interested in the intersection of data science and health care, and I would love to gain exposure of how data science can be applied to life science problems. 

Another reason I am highly interested in this project is the association to UCSF. This premier medical establishment would help connect me with industry professionals and introduce me to the world of life science. I believe this institution has the data and resources to make a positive impact towards heart disease. I am interested to pursue a career in the intersection of life science and data science after graduation, so working on a research project throughout the semester would help educate me on medical research and further my career as a data scientist. ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"I am very interested about gaining formal research experience at a premier institution such as LBNL. This research project appeals to me because I will be working with a very relevant aspect of our technological world: streaming data. This project enables me to connect my passion for data science and finance, which would be a unique experience to be a part of. I believe working with a strong team and mentor will challenge me to use all my past experiences to improve prediction techniques for streaming data. Also, I believe I will learn about how a national laboratory approaches research.

As I am entering my last semester at Berkeley, I would like to dedicate the majority of my time towards furthering my academic experiences and gaining exposure to new applications of data science. Last summer I worked for Tubi, the largest free movie and television video on demand platform, and I experienced the on-hand complexities of large data sets and the issues with streaming large format content. I believe this unique experience at LBNL will help me develop my data science skills, compliment my past experience, and connect me with fellow researchers also interested in big data challenges.

The book “Outliers” by Malcolm Gladwell made me want to be part of the search for the Master algorithm. 

Recently, I created my own chatbot and have been training it. When more people interact with the bot, the more intelligent it grows. The challenge remains in tuning the NLP algorithms for better accuracy. My ambition is to create unsupervised algorithms for my bot to become self-learning. 

Another interest that holds me is reverse engineering the brain. To truly explore artificial intelligence, there are questions that need to be answered. Why was our brain created as two distinct parts rather than a unified sphere? Why is the resonance of the left and the right brain so difficult in humans? Music and math, two realms I love, may have some of these answers. They are the universal languages and the languages of the universe. Would our advancement in machine learning be congruous enough to leave higher level right brain functions like emotional intelligence, creativity, intuition and conscious thought to humans? Or are we going to scuttle it all by trying to replicate something that we still do not understand very well?  Mapping synaptic paths in neural networks, image and voice recognition with back propagation are just some aspects I want to delve deeper into.","While at CERN, exploring topics of creation, genesis and infinium, the Higgs Boson; some very pertinent questions bothered me. Is the quest of knowledge through science our holy grail that brings us closer to our creators? Is our known universe part of a bigger continuum? Imagine if laws that created us were established by creators who were themselves created by another species in an infinite continuum. Science is equipping humans to be creators of another life form. But do we understand ourselves well enough to do so? Is the fear of Singularity real? Can AI replicate AI in the next decade? 

While the projects being developed in Discovery Research probably won’t answer these questions, the learning gained through and with others would equip me with the tools to engage in the debate. Contributing to rational, technical and ethical progress of these questions is a dream.","Inclusion and communication are key in teamwork. Making sure that everyone feels like their input is being heard and delegating tasks to each person that complements their strength or is aligned to their interests makes for an efficient team. There should be a mutual respect among team members so that if one falls short of solving a problem, he/she doesn't mind accepting help from another team member to get the job done. Personally, communication of ideas and struggles is important for me to best help one another and the project as a whole. ",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"Coming from a country of around 20 languages, the premise of the project is intriguing.

	I’m on the ChemE car competition team as part of the electrical sub team. Exploring both hardware and software, I’ve become invested in our project: designing a complex circuit for the car. I’m really glad I decided to become involved with the electrical engineering part of EECS, as building a physical product has proved fulfilling. 
	Carrying on a trend from high school, I also continued to teach coding, through a committee in SWE. I volunteered each Saturday at a camp for middle school girls - some of my favorite memories of college so far. Although I can’t do that camp this semester because conflicts, it’s made me realize both outreach and teaching are going to be parts of my academic career. ","	As an EECS major, I’ve been working to gain a solid general coding foundation. After taking EE16A and working through the machine learning unit, I realized that machine learning, especially applied to data, is an area of interest that I had not anticipated entering college. 
	By participating in Discovery Research, I’m hoping to gain a foundation for data science that I can build off of for the rest of college and beyond. More importantly, I’m hoping to contribute to a project that can make real change. Because I'm so early in my academic career, it would be exciting for me to see a project over a longer period of time as well. Though I do love learning in a classroom setting, I’ve been antsy waiting for an opportunity to do real technical work. Working alongside accomplished peers and mentors would be an invaluable experience. ","	The point of teamwork, as opposing to approaching a problem alone, is the diversification of skill sets, opinions, and viewpoints. In my opinion, a team should have a common goal, and each member different ways to get to that goal. Then, the task is only to work together to combine and improve paths, taking in everyone’s opinions as the process moves along. 
	I’ve been in a lot of teams, from two varsity sports in high school to academic competitions to hackathons. One thing I’ve learned since being in college is that teamwork does not have to be competitive. The collaborative nature of classes gives the “everyone can win” kind of environment - by helping your classmate out, you both will do better. This is a sentiment I hope to bring to research: teamwork for the sake of discovery, not competition. ",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"This project immediately struck me as extremely interesting. Coming from two attorney parents, the dinner table conversations often revolved around law, and the term Supreme Court was thrown around often. I've known for a long time how difficult it is to get your case read to the Supreme Court, but I never made the connection that this could in fact be data science research. I'd be eager to explore how to analyze these cases with a technical skillset. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I was in high school last year, and I remember the environment quite clearly.

However, I now realize this approach to thinking about that question is flawed-- I should think of the future and what I want to achieve. Entering Berkeley I really did not know what I wanted to study. For a long time, I wanted to pursue a medical degree, but quickly realized that I did not want to be a doctor. I've pondered biology, chemistry, and any other related path you could think of. All of these potential fields of study were fueled by my own food allergy diagnosis and struggles. This continues to be the motivation behind my studies, though I've now discovered a new way to advance my passions of allergy prevention -- data science. From what I've seen, there are many existing data science research projects that are analyzing medical data for the purpose of medical advancements and disease prevention. ","Through the Discovery Program, I hope to gain a better insight into what the field of data science is truly about, and be able to discover my niche within it. Data science related research and jobs intrigue me immensely, but I'm intimidated by the fact that I am rather inexperienced in the field. Thus, I hope to gain more knowledge about data science analysis, as well as new research methods and techniques. Furthermore, I hope to gain experience in analysis of medical data, as that particularly intrigues me. ","When working in a group setting, I am firm with other group members though careful to not be overbearing. Through various situations involving teamwork, I've recognized that teamwork leads to better and quicker results, which is why it's important that all team members put forth their best efforts. Holding everyone accountable for their share of the work is the foundation of good teamwork and what I consider to be the most important aspect of any situation involving group work. ",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,"I'm very interested by the intersection of healthcare and data science and this meta-analysis project seems to be a very interesting intersection of these two topics. Additionally, the potential for this project to result in medical advancements is very enticing. Also, I want to work on a project in which I could be useful in analyzing the data. Though I'm not sure what specific technique will be used for data compilation and analysis, I'm prepared to learn these techniques thoroughly and produce meaningful results. What I really admire about this project (and many other data science research projects) is the cost-effectiveness, due to the use of already existing data. As noted, it is costly and arduous to collect new data on  various drugs and their relative effectiveness in treating Crohn's disease. In using the raw data, this project will produce medically significant results at a low cost, which is exciting to be a part of. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I'm interested in the Pathologists Cancer Alert Project primarily due to the potential for tangible results in the healthcare field. Though the data analysis aspect and inspiration for this project are of great interest to me, the probable reduction in cancer mortality is very exciting and makes me want to be a part of this project. Moreover, I'm very intrigued by the electronic pathology technology to be used in this project, as I'm fascinated with the intersection of healthcare and data science. The exposure to both fields-- as well as such novel technology and analysis techniques-- is an exciting prospect. Additionally, the AI used in this project in order to compare the pathology reports seems interesting and I'm enthusiastic to learn more about how it works.

On the surface math seems clean and friendly but when it comes down to nitty gritty proofs get dirty and people string together some of the craziest deductions and logic to prove a simple statement is true. It really makes me appreciate simple elegance when I see it and how much effort and work gets put together to make proofs happen and to shorten them. After the first year of consistent serious lifting, progress slows down rapidly, and it really just comes down to dialing in technique and recovery and maintaining that over years and years. Large quality software is super cool. I love seeing good complexity management combined with nuance in a codebase.","From a technical standpoint, I am interested in how machine learning and data science are applied to the development of predictive algorithms and how infrastructure around these algorithms are built.

Despite a lengthy commute and hectic schedule, since I am newly declared and committed to the data science field, I am looking to garner a better understanding of how exactly I can fit my side passions into my academic pursuit. I have had to pleasure of meeting with professionals from different sectors of the field through my work experiences in order to pose the question of what the data science profession entails, and have found that it is an extremely broad and emerging field. Through this, I have found particular interest in user interface experience (UX) and design, and expanding my expertise into the intersection of business and data.","I continue to pursue a definition of what data science is as a field of work and study, as well as a definition of what sector I will fit in best. I would like to build a network with students that are on the same journey of discovery, and educators that can offer expertise and guidance to support it. Additionally, I would like to gain a sense of independence and confidence in myself to pursue my passions. Coming into Berkeley, I had been pressured into the medical field, and ultimately deciding that I was not passionate enough about it and taking the risk of switching my major so drastically has wrought immense stress on me. I am frankly worried about how I will fare amongst students that have been exposed to the field for much longer, but I hope that the support the Data Science Discovery program offers will help me overcome it.
","My approach to teamwork, from a lead perspective, garners inspiration from the SCRUM framework for managing complex work. In application, this would involve implementing a routine of daily meetings in order to keep each team member informed on the full operation, and promoting an open communication platform. This would enable all members from all sectors of the operation to propose critique and suggestions, offering diverse perspectives. I believe that incorporating every member's expertise and opinions allows the consideration of previously unforeseen opportunities, as well as encourages participation and involvement. Ensuring all members feel equally important is crucial, as I believe that people who feel they are not providing worthy contributions tend to lose interest and passion in the project, and furthermore undermines the discovery of potential breakthrough proposals.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"The mission of this project feels particularly personal to me, having been close to a homeless student in an urban environment. There are undeniably several crucial environment issues that make the Bay Area particularly difficult to survive homelessness in, but presenting the issue as urgent enough to garner the interest of policymakers to address is a great barrier to reform. It is so easy to inadvertently fall into a dangerous and violent situation here, a threat much further experienced by those without the resources and knowledge to avoid such matters and protect themselves. If I am able to contribute my skills in any way towards achieving SF-YEAH's mission of convincing policymakers, social service providers, and researchers to support prevention efforts helping young people with homelessness, I would be immensely driven to fight towards the same goal.",Innovation Resources Database,"I believe in the expansion of awareness with opportunities specified towards women in fields of technology, aimed towards challenging the stigma that the field is predominantly meant for men. The Innovation Resources Database is one that I have personally used in my search for local opportunities to advance my career, as I have had difficulty finding the specific support systems established on campus. I believe in the mission of the project, to enhance and encourage women's pursuit of success in a traditionally impacted career field.

When I first came to Berkeley I was undeclared engineering and wasn’t sure of what I wanted to do. I took 61a because other people pressured me into it and have been doing CS courses ever since. I dabbled in a few other fields of CS such as virtual reality but did not develop much interest in it. However, this past semester, Fall 2019, I took Data 100 and it was the first CS course I really enjoyed and spent way more time on it compared to other classes I had taken in the past. Hence I want to continue down this path of Data Science to apply what I learned and to gain a practical understanding of the data life cycle.
Outside of Data Science, I am interested in psychology and economics. In particular, I am interested in the way human behavior impacts financial markets. Eventually, I want to apply data science to this field by using my understanding of human behavior to create models of financial markets. In my spare time, I enjoy reading books on psychology, finance, and economics.","I wish to gain a deeper understanding of how the data life cycle is used in real life through research projects. In a class environment, the learning and projects are really structured with a clear direction of what happens next. However, I want to participate in Discovery Research to take more initiative in the process rather than passively letting it happen, like a class. Therefore I think this would be a great opportunity for me to learn about data science in a real-world context to also see if it is something I would be interested in pursuing after graduation.
Additionally, I wish to gain experience with more libraries and learn how they are used in the process of data collection and cleaning, EDA, and modeling. Finally, I hope to gain experience in collaborating with others on data science projects. In the past, a lot of the projects I have done have been on my own, hence it would be a nice change of pace to work with others and learn the dynamics of being on a team in the context of data science research.","For my approach to teamwork, I always get started by discussing what others expect of me, and what I expect of others in terms of time commitment, actual work done. From my experience, I found it easier for a team to collaborate if each person knows what is expected of them so that they can deliver that. 
Throughout the project, I think frequent check-ups are a nice way of seeing if progress is moving in the right overall direction, however, I am fine with doing a bulk of the work on my own before checking in with my teammates. 
Additionally, I also think that teams work best when every person knows what is going on for every part of the project. While setting expectations may seem like delegation of tasks, which is sometimes okay for menial things, every person needs to see the bigger picture of the project so that everyone is on the same page. Hence meetings, where each person shares and explains what they are contributing, are important to keep a team working cohesively.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"I am interested in this project because it is in the crossover of my interests that I previously mentioned—using human behavioral elements to predict markets. In this case, the data collected pertains to political and cultural dynamics impacting the cannabis market in the United States. Hence a project like this would be something I would enjoy most and would potentially get the most out of. The taking of unstructured data and turning it into a presentable, useful data set is something that I have experience in and enjoy doing. Finding trends and features in the data is also something that I have experience in and I believe I can contribute in a meaningful way to find out what is impacting the cannabis market.
Additionally, I believe that the cannabis market is emerging in the United States and new data appearing every day presents a great opportunity to do some data analysis on it. ",Student Success Analytics Platform,"I am interested in this project because I have always been interested in what factors make a good student. There are many people I know that have different study styles, work ethics, and ambitions but I have never thought to turn all of those factors into a machine-learning algorithm to predict success. I want to be a part of this project because I think there are important implications; if we can predict student success, we can also figure out the best way for students to be successful using this data. I am also interested in this project because it reminds me of Josh Hug’s anonymous data collection and analysis of all of his students and their success over time-based on factors such as CS background and years of prior coding before taking his classes.
Additionally, I have always been interested in different factors that make a good student. I have read many books on productivity and studying and hence I would be interested in seeing how these ideas apply in a real-world scenario with actual data from students.  ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"I am interested in this project because it involves the crossover of my interests in data science and finance. During my algorithms class, I found streaming data to be one of the more interesting topics because of its practicality and challenging constraints. Thus applying it in a practical sense to develop prediction techniques is something that I find interesting and would like to be part of. 
Additionally, I would like to be a part of this project because I want to learn more about and get hands-on experience with how computer science is used in the field of finance. In the future, I hope to work somewhere between the two since that is where I have the most interest, hence this would be a good place to get started and learn about the practical applications of computer science in finance.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,Through a friend,No,1,

I care a lot about equality, social justice and the environment, and I think that having the tools of data science under my belt will help me to make a positive impact on the world. I hope that participating in the Discovery Research program will improve my skills in data science. I believe data is capable of telling a story, and I want to be a part of bringing those stories to light. Through working on a project, I would also really like to connect with a mentor in the field of data science, who is open to teaching me more about the profession as a whole and its possibilities. It would be wonderful to have a mentor’s advice as I find my path in the field of data science. ","I think teamwork is extremely important as it allows all individuals to achieve much more. When working together and collaborating, a team has the potential to excel beyond what any individual could do alone. For teamwork to be positive and effective, it is key to have open, clear communication among all members of the team. Having clear expectations and making sure all members are kept up to date on others’ roles and tasks ensures that work is done in an efficient manner, and will also help to foster an environment in which all team members feel proud of the work they’ve accomplished. In order to have clear communication, a team must also have mutual respect for one another, and a certain level of comfort. To be able to openly have productive discussions, all team members must feel that they are valued and respected individually.

A supreme court justice is the most powerful position that can be held in the public sector.  As such, it comes with an immense amount of responsibility and requires the absolute trust of the public. When Kavanaugh was elected to the Supreme Court, I became interested in how politics might impact the decisions of the court. However, while I agree with the decisions some of the Supreme Court justices have made and disagree with others, it is undeniable that all people have inherent biases. Because the Supreme Court holds such a large amount of power in the United States, it is interesting to see what the members of the court consider to be important cases, and how this has been shaped depending on who is serving on the court at the time. Whether or not the Supreme Court feels a case should be reviewed directly impacts and reflects the lives of Americans and the values of the United States, something I think would be very interesting to study.",Wahve,"I am doing an economics emphasis for the data science major, and I am very interested in labor economics.

From excellent data visualization packages to interacting with multiple data sources, my interest grew, especially when I worked on my final project for this course. The project was on digit recognition and the machine learning method that we used was k-Nearest Neighbors. Our professor gave sample code for us to replicate with the new data set, but I realized that his method took hours to run.

My name is Cjache, but I just go by Jake. I'm originally from Nome, Alaska and moved to California seven years ago - when I came to Berkeley, I was first interested in Business due to my parents owning a restaurant. However, influenced by the tech-orientated atmosphere, I decided to try a computer science class and loved it! Now my interests lie in anything tech and in my last few semesters at Berkeley, I would love to learn as much as possible. I have been participating in as many as coding and data competitions in order to hone my skills. My true passion, however, lies in applying my skills in social good - more specifically, in education. Since Alaska's education system lacks a lot of resources, I want to equalize the education playing field.","What I wish to gain through participating in Discovery Research is not only knowledge and growth but the ability to make an impact. I have been a research assistant for a psychology-related lab for the past two years and would love to learn what research is like in data science-related disciplines. In addition, I wish to improve my knowledge of data science so that I will be able to apply my skills during my remaining time at Berkeley and after I graduate. Lastly, while I am learning, I hope to apply my new skills in order to make a difference in the world, whether it be social good, for a company, or for research!","Having been in a research team for the past two years, I learned the most important aspect of a team is to have enjoy ourselves. That is, it is important to complete work, but I believe it's more important to establish rapport, whether that be through team-bonding activities or through a simple introductory meeting. After establishing a high amount of trust and familiarity with other team members, I found that it was much easier to work with others and that we completed work at a much more efficient rate.

However I soon realized how vast the definition of sustainability is and how much it encompasses. I started narrowing down my interests to sustainable energy, which led me to research in novel materials for batteries and solar panels. This research was interesting and I learned very much, however it was also extremely slow-paced. The solutions developed though it would be developed in 10-20 years. This pointed me towards data science, as it has great potential to contribute to sustainable energy systems right now. Armed with knowledge from Data Science 100 (CS 100) and a variety of engineering classes on energy systems (EE 137A, EE 134, ChE 176, Civ Eng 295) I wish to get involved in an energy project in the Data Science Discovery Program. ","Through Discovery Research, I want to experience a real-world Data Science research project. I’ve been a part of data science projects, but they have been for classes, where there is a safety net ready to catch you when you fall and a “correct answer” already exists. In Discovery Research I would enjoy exploring datasets from scratch and considering multiple approaches, even with a few wrong turns.
Furthermore, I also wish to understand the implications of large datasets. Academic projects often times utilize extremely large datasets, which can lead to better inference but at the same time more challenges during data cleaning and algorithm runtime. This leads to creative solutions and collaboration with interdisciplinary teams. Overall, I want a taste of what a data scientist does when real datasets are involved. ","I believe teamwork is coming together to achieve more than would have been possible independently. Teamwork requires discussion and collaboration, not simply splitting the work. Teamwork requires understanding that not everyone can be the best at everything, so we must help each other in our weaknesses through our strengths. Overall, teamwork is when each person contributes their strength at the same time they are improving their weaknesses with the help of others.  ",Thermal Unit Characterization Based on Data,"I am interested in this project because I believe renewable energy integration to the grid is essential, yet it hasn’t been fully understood. After taking EE 137A with Prof. Von Meier I realized how complex the grid is and how important it is to operate it in a stable state. I believe machine learning is a great way to dive into this subject and I would be eager to contribute to and learn from this project. In terms of preparation, I have taken: CS61A, CS61B, Data 100, EE 137A (power systems/legacy grid), EE 134 (photovoltaic devices), ChEng 176 (electrochemical systems), ChEng 141 (thermodynamics). ",Forecasting Day Ahead Electric Load using a Machine Learning Application and Bottom-up Aggregation of Individual Meters,"I am interested in this project because I believe grid resilience will be essential in the transition to sustainable energy, so being able to forecast electricity demand will be essential in adequately dispatching energy resources. Solving this problem with machine learning would be very interesting, as it would allow us to identify which factors are the most important. This would inform decisions on which renewable energy technologies are the most appropriate. In terms of preparation, I have taken: CS61A, CS61B, Data 100, EE 137A (power systems/legacy grid), EE 134 (photovoltaic devices), ChEng 176 (electrochemical systems), ChEng 141 (thermodynamics). ",Anomaly detection in Solar Microgrids,"I am interested in this project because I believe solar microgrids are very important in the transition to renewable energy, and will become even more prevalent in the coming years. Therefore, understanding solar microgrids and being able to predict anomalies in them will be essential. 

I have experience in solar from and R&D internship at SunPower last summer. I believe it would be extremely interesting to take a step back from the physical system and experiments on solar cells, and instead explore what machine learning can uncover about solar systems. Solar systems generate a lot of data so there must be valuable information to be found. 

In terms of preparation, I have taken: CS61A, CS61B, Data 100, EE 134 (photovoltaic devices), EE 137A (power systems/legacy grid), ChEng 176 (electrochemical systems), ChEng 141 (thermodynamics). ",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,Piazza for Data 001,"No, thank you :)",1,

Through the Discovery Research, I hope to gain new perspectives and learn new skills that are much more useful than what is taught in a classroom.","Most of my life, I have worked in committees and teams, and the most significant belief I have about teamwork is making sure everybody's voice is heard. Inclusivity is what helps advances a team forward. When I was younger, I was always shy to contribute my ideas because I was afraid that it would be shot down, or be ridiculed for not being a great idea. However, I came to realize through working in different team settings that any idea, despite small or large, is one of the most valuable aspects a team can have.

It all started when I started taking advanced computer science in high school. Based on the coding skills I learned during this class, I applied to be part of the STEM Fellowship which is a stem research fellowships that offer students the chance to explore their particular interests. I chose to make a phone application and it required a lot of coding knowledge and ideas. During this process, I learned something called design thinking process and it is very helpful for me until now. There is more information about this STEM Fellowship project in :http://kbk6881.wixsite.com/sabin-kim/prototype. The information is under STEM Fellowship in the website. I also expanded my academic interests by working on 3D printing on my own. I tried to build our school buildings using Meshmixer and CAD. It was a fulfilling experience for me because I got a chance to work on things that I usually do not work on. I love working on areas that I do not have full knowledge of because I like gaining different knowledge step by step through my experience.

","

By participating in Discovery Research,
I want to conduct more projects related to data science. I believe I had gain some knowledge of what data science is as I conducted several projects during classes and DSS. I want to improve my skills through Discovery Research as I will have chance to learn even more complicated subjects and materials that I did not really had opportunities to learn in other parts. I also want to meet students who share similar interests with me and discuss my ideas to others. I believe improving results based on different people’s ideas are key part in having successful project and I am glad that Discovery Research provides me with an environment where students can participate freely.
","
My approach to teamwork is that all should work together to yield a great result. Everyone should be able to speak up with their ideas and improve upon ideas gathered as a team. Everyone should equally work hard to maximize a teamwork. There should not be people who work too much or work too less. In other words, other obligations should not hurt the team’s collective goals. In terms of myself, I am that kind of person who seeks help whenever there is something that I do not understand. I need to communicate my difficulties to get help. I also express my ideas freely as I want my ideas to be reflected in the project that I am working on. When there are some clashes between teammates, I do not force other teammates to agree on my ideas but rather try to find solutions that can fit all of our thoughts. I tend to carefully listen to other teammates ideas as there can be more useful and conventional ideas.
",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I am interested in this project because I also have interest in biology part of data science. In high school, as I mentioned earlier, I have experience in building web application for helping those in emergent situations. I wanted to help others with the knowledge I have in computer programming. I believe this project is another opportunity for me to help those in need.

My curiosity has led to me to learn about all sorts of subjects, from domestic and international policy issues to anatomy. Since coming to Berkeley and learning CS and data science for the first time, I feel that I can take my curiosity one step further; instead of just knowing why certain problems or phenomena occur, I now have a skillset to engineer solutions.

As an EECS major, I’m interested in gaining a deep understanding of how the technology that powers the world works in order to design technologies of the future that benefit all humans equally. Outside of EECS and data science, I’m really passionate about education. I view education as a fundamental right and something everyone must have, because a stimulating education challenges students’ ideas and views of the world. Part of my passion for education includes a passion for teaching, which is why I’ve been involved with teaching CS courses at Berkeley (both as a TA/course staff and through Computer Science Mentors) since my second semester at Cal. Additionally, I’ve been working with science and math teachers at my high school to rethink how STEM subjects are taught at the school, because I feel the school can do a lot better preparing students for college.","The primary reason for my interest in Discovery Research is I want to gain the opportunity to use my data science experience to solve real problems for real organizations, as opposed to me choosing a toy problem for me to solve on my own. I think there is a lot of value in working on industry or research problems not only because of the real-world impact, but also because devising solutions without structure or help that is usually given in a classroom setting is a learning experience I can’t replicate on my own. Outside of that, I hope to learn from my teammates and project leads about how to further my data science knowledge/experience outside of taking courses.","In high school, I lead a team which aimed to increase the college attendance rate in my hometown by educating students about the benefits of attending college and connecting students’ families to resources for guidance on filling out college applications and financial aid. Ultimately, we were able to reach thousands of high school students, but there were many bumps along the road due to members of the team not pulling their weight. Upon reflecting on this experience, I realized I didn’t properly do my job as the project lead to make sure everyone was motivated and working towards the goal. Therefore, for future projects (even when I’m not the lead), I changed my approach to make sure to frequently validate and recognize the work/effort my team members put in so they know their input is valued. I’ve found that when fellow team members give positive feedback, it becomes much easier to provide constructive criticism when necessary because the person receiving feedback knows that their teammates actually care about their work.",Cal Alumni Association Analysis of Engaged Alumni,"I worked on this project in the summer in its first ""semester"" with Discovery.

To this end, I am currently double-majored in Computer Science and Chemica Biology. But outside of Data Science - I am passionate about the environment, social activism, technology law.

In BEACN - a environmentally-conscious consulting organization - we work together to find solutions to contribute to sustainable business development. What this actually looks like is that we either help an environmentally-driven company carry out their goals or help a corporation become more sustainable in its day-to-day actions. In my time at BEACN, I led a team to develop a database and app for an electric vehicle company, which showed me how computational technology could be used to benefit a sustainable cause.

As a part of the LGBTQ+ community, I am aware of the hardships that affect not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also all the other communities that intersect with ours. That being said, my time in the UNITY Program at Cal not only gave me the knowledge and experience to be an engaged advocate, but also taught me how to take Pride in my identity.

Through legal research about technological privacy, I read how Facebook tracks non-Facebook users through “shadow profiles,” or how China is researching deep learning to classify criminality based on facial features without regard to the ethical impacts. Learning about these developments is terrifyingly interesting, and it’s what motivates me to learn the technical nuances to better understand them. ","I want to work on project that I know I would truly enjoy and appreciate. Looking back, I realize that I definitely cared too much about the the “buzz words” and “novel applications of new technological techniques” when looking for certain opportunities, and that largely contributed my dissatisfaction with last semester’s Discovery Project.

This infatuation with what I thought I should be doing also prevented me from achieving last semester’s personal goal - which was to contribute to a project that would accomplish social good. So this semester, I also hope to make good on that goal.","As I’ve since learned from last semester’s project, my approach to teamwork is clear weekly goals and constant communication. I work most effectively when I have a clear goal in mind. When that goal isn’t provided, I have trouble taking initiative since I don’t know what efforts will be the most beneficial to the overall project vision.

Constant communication is also key. There have been many times when time critical decisions needed to be made and key individuals weren’t there to consult or contribute. The outcome was much stress and a sub-quality product. My approach to teamwork is to avoid the time crunch as much as possible, so I find that I work best with others who also share those values.",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"I don’t like to think about it, but the Justices have and continue to determine my freedoms and protections as an LGBTQ+ individual in America. The progress since Obergefell could just as easily be forwarded or reversed with the upcoming descions of last October’s slate of LGBTQ+ employment cases - and with a conservative majority, I’m scared. 

From what I’ve seen, the granting of certirorari can be an intensely stragtetic decision with profound consequences. Even if the case is ultimately not heard, granting cert can ignite much needed conversations and propel a relatively niche topic to the public consciousness- as was the case in Grimm vs. Gloucester. Even more importantly, with the current majority on the bench, an outcome of a case could theoretically be determined soon as the 4 or 5 Justices agree to hear a case.

I’ve always wondered about the specific rationale in deciding to grant certiorari, if there were any “strategies” in granting certiorari. This project is a perfect opportunity to answer that long-held question and contribute to an increasingly important topic with my data-science and CS skills. Grating certiorari marks the beginning of a decision that has had and will continue to have drastic effects on my life.

Because of this, I came to college wanting to major in Biochemistry. Throughout my first year, I realized that this was not a topic that interested me enough to want to major in it. I also realized that I great interest in Data Science through taking Data 8 (I was convinced to take this class with a few friends) and enrolling in Data Scholars Foundations. Being introduced to Data Science and seeing what I can do with it made me see that this is was I want to study in college. Outside of this, in college, I have also realized a passion for dancing, which has taught me diligence while giving me another community and a safe space to see improvement in myself. I have also gotten more in touch with Filipino culture (I am half Filipino) in college by participating in UC Berkeley Pilipino Community and being an active member of one of its organizations and volunteering at various events, such as Senior Weekend (where admitted high school seniors stay on campus and given a look into campus life at Berkeley).","I believe Discovery Research can provide me with a space where I can not only apply Data Science/computing skills I have already learned in the classroom in a practical setting but also grow as a Data Scientist by using them. I also believe that I will be able to learn and acquire more Data Science skills in this unique opportunity to work on a project that will be extremely useful in my future. I will also be able to see first hand the applications of Data Science in a different setting, outside of class.","My main approach to teamwork includes getting input from every member involved. Every member involved must have their voice heard and the group can benefit greatly from diverse opinions that can guide the team. I feel it is important that as a team, we ensure that no single member is working much harder or much less than the others and that we help each other when needed. I also want everyone to know their skills are needed and will try to make sure that tasks are delegated appropriately and with consideration of everyone’s skillset. Overall, I enjoy collaboration as it is most efficient and gives more an opportunity to work and grow and because of this, I seek to make collaboration the backbone of whenever I work with a group of people.",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"I am interested in this project because I have worked at a Berkeley Public School and interacted with a diverse group of students while working there as a BUILD Mentor (through UC Berkeley). Achievement gaps are apparent as, on average, certain groups of students are predisposed to opportunities that will lead to wider gaps. I think it is important to address achievement gaps and seek to minimize them but this can only be done by identifying them (which this project seeks to do). This project will allow me to apply and learn Data Science skills uniquely as I will working with data I have seen in person (having worked to mentor students at a Berkeley Public School).",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"While I have yet to take a Political Science/Government course at UC Berkeley, throughout high school (particularly in my Government class), I found the Supreme Court to be of great interest. I am invested in being able to apply Data Science skills I already have and grow my skillset with this project as the question of interest (“What makes a case important enough to merit the Supreme Court’s attention?”) is a question I also had when learning about the Supreme Court as it may be seemingly objective but there may also be an underlying standard. This is why this project interests me as it seeks to answer a question that I am interested in and would enjoy being a part of analyzing the data to answer the question.",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I am interested in this project because I believe the cause of women in tech (as a woman wanting to pursue a career in tech) to be important and would like to see and help visualize the current numbers behind it.

These traits have pushed me toward achievements in places far from home. I was born in New Jersey but moved to Albania when I was 10. There, I witnessed lifestyles that motivated me to work harder for myself and others.
Back in the U.S., I was able to work on math research, creating free 3D printed prosthetics and cognitive music therapy experiments. Most importantly, I became involved with Phi Theta Kappa, the international honors society for two year colleges. As a member of their board and as the international president, I was able to advocate for community college students across the world. I used my love for science and helping others to inform my decision to become a data scientist and hope to use data in the non-profit sector in the short future. 
","When I lived in Albania, I made visits to very remote villages that seemed like resourceless bubbles in our technological world. These villages do not only exist in Albania. A personal project of mine is to gather data on the needs of villages like these, and create a platform for non-profits and businesses alike to be able to access them. 
In order to continue improving the skills I need to help others with, I should start using them more practically and not just in a classroom setting. That experience is what I want to gain in Discovery Research. Many of the projects for spring 2020 seem to have social impact in their nature. I felt my best when I was using my time and skills to help others, and I hope to continue that with the Discovery Program. 
","At my previous organization, I was given a personality test and was surprised to notice inclusivity was my main trait. Soon I discovered that it was not so surprising. Much of my drive comes from my desire for everyone to have the same resources and be included in the same activities as others, regardless of their birth circumstances. Similarly, when I am part of a team, I often find myself involving others and asking for opinions from people that don’t speak as much. When I have different ideas than others, I make it a point to consider everyone else’s approaches first and intervene after considering everything objectively. I have worked with teams when it comes to student advocacy, creating free prosthetics and brain research, and I believe I am caring and considerate enough to be considered a good teammate.

My dad who was a Software Engineer always seemed stressed and frustrated; every time he talked about his job, it felt like he took 1 step forward and 2 steps backward. Therefore, I vowed to never take CS courses in college. But, here I am as a Data Science major. I have always had a passion for mathematics which led me to become a Mathematics major, then a Statistics major, and finally a Data Science major. I guess you could say the appeal of this new major really sucked me in, despite not wanting to take CS61A or CS61B. But, after taking Data 8 and Data 100, I truly do love coding for the sake of data analysis. I love problem-solving, being creative yet critical about the topic at hand, and visually seeing your overall progress through modeling and statistical testing methods. No doubt, I was very skeptical of this major at the beginning, but I truly do appreciate it and am glad to call it my major and future career.","After taking Data 100, I am very happy with the knowledge and experience I have gained, but want to further my application of machine learning algorithms to a field more relevant to my emphasis in Economics. I have analyzed economic/financial data in Excel by building tables and visualizations, but not to the extent of my Python-based projects. I am graduating this May and I want to use this last semester to improve my data visualization skills (on Tableau, PowerBI, etc.), learn more ML algorithms, and apply my critical-thinking skills in the Economics field. ","Only the most productive and communicative teams are able to be successful and I apply this theory to all of my experiences.

From working on science experiments to taking a full year of advanced computer science, chemistry, physics, and various math courses, my passion in this area has only grown. As I developed an interest in STEM, I started to explore this area outside of the classroom. My hands-on experiences through many years in the FIRST programs helped me understand the application of math and science in solving both every day and complex technological and engineering problems. I took my interest one step further as I collaborated with other AP Computer Science students at the Northwest Advanced Programming Workshop to develop maze solving algorithms. There, I received the opportunity to work in a simulation of professional software development lifecycle with milestones and deadlines to meet. Now at UC Berkeley, I have taken both EECS courses for my major, and other courses to explore different fields of computation, including Data 8. In fact, Data Science merges my passion for computer science and the enjoyment I found through my AP Statistics course in high school, and it is an area I want to delve deeper in.","When I took Data 8 last semester, I thoroughly enjoyed the projects and topics I learned, from setting up hypothesis tests to table operations to creating classifiers. Through Discovery Research, I look forward to expanding my data science knowledge and fostering my newfound interest in data science, while contributing to a research project applicable in the real-world. From the foundation that I have built through introductory data science courses and an extensive background of computer science-related courses, I will be an effective co-creator in order to help the organization achieve their data challenges through data modeling and analysis. In addition, I will be able to work with other students, research leads, and research partners to build a collaborative community of data scientists, in order to conduct meaningful research, learn together, and ultimately complete the goals of the research project.","My approach to teamwork is centered around having every team member contribute to their full potential by embracing the team’s diversity to achieve the common goal. As the lead for my high school robotics team, I was responsible for assuring the productivity of four sub-groups. These groups comprised of individuals with specific skill sets, including programmers, builders, robot drivers, and marketers, in order to organize the team based on subject areas. The integration of these various parts required me to not only learn interpersonal skills, but also project management ones. I tackled this large responsibility by respecting and listening to the needs of my teammates to ensure they were successful at completing their individual work, and thus solving and proactively avoiding conflicts. I encouraged members to choose tasks that both interested them and aligned with their strengths, enabling each individual to make effective contributions and find their place.

I loved automating simple tasks I saw around me using motors, light sensors and basic C programs. Soon, I realized the unlimited potential of autonomous robots which used complex programs that learn from their mistakes. Thus, by the time I was a junior in high school, I entered the world of Machine Learning through an online Stanford course taught by Andrew Ng on ML. I understood how all STEM fields are dependent, linked and ultimately built on the pillars of the scientific method and mathematical truths. In my Summer 2019 internship, I was fortunate enough to work as a software engineer intern at a fintech startup directly under the guidance of the CEO. When I realized the lack of organizational structure and the absence of basic back-end network architecture in the company, I seized the opportunity and took up extra responsibilities to act as both a product developer and a scrum master. In the process, I realized how even the financial features of a company are intricately intertwined with its disruptive technology. I understood that technology is mostly complementary to a disruptive data-driven business model.","I have always been open to a wide variety of fields of research and development in STEM. Data Science has given me the ability to pursue interdisciplinary endeavors that use the rigorous math of statistics and the multilayered abstractions of computer science as effective tools to measure, discover patterns and ultimately bring real change in the real world. By participating in Discovery Research I hope that in addition to me building on top of my industry experience of building a data-driven startup, I can also gain the opportunity to learn how Academia uses Data Science to augment the scientific method for researching real world problems. I want to gain the opportunity to work under accomplished professors and professionals who can mentor me to become a better Data Scientist, a better learner and a better person. As a newly declared Data Science major, I want to establish my career foundations through a research endeavor by learning how to work with a big team, learning Data Science and building a close network of colleagues. ","I value teamwork over working independently because different people bring different perspectives to the table which leads to sustainable, well-rounded and rigorously thought-out efforts. As a team member I strive to motivate others and seek inspiration among my team and by doing so, I create and participate in a community or family that shares and cares. When communicating with teammates I strive to be aware of the fact that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to voice their opinions and take turns in leading the conversation. At my summer internship, I was responsible for creating the back-end network architecture and also leading the front-end design and development team. My team was able to complete all product backlog tasks on time because we followed effective Scrum strategies and also maximized the effort of each team member with respect to their area of expertise. When me or my teammates recognized that one of us was unable to perform up to our full potential, we approached the situation with sensitivity, mutual respect and attentive listening.",Data visualization and analytics for off-grid solar in Africa,"As a Data Science major with a domain emphasis in Business/Industrial Analytics, this project seems to me as the perfect blend of business analytic research and machine learning applications on census and geographical data. The first work-stream is interesting because I can see myself using my experience of competitor analysis from my summer internship where we tried to predict the success of our competitors business models based on randomized client trading tendencies and accordingly adjusted our business model. In the second work-stream, I’m very excited to use open source Facebook AI and Open Street Maps because I want to build on my experience with valuing real estate properties using machine learning algorithms on Python TensorFlow.

To track the changes in the stock market in real time and balance our valuations, we realized that we needed a quick way to capture and automatically load streaming data onto our cloud on EC2. We used this constant but always changing streaming data to predict future streaming data that we would eventually acquire. It was an extremely interesting project that I took up and I'd love to continue learning more about this through the Streaming data analysis project at LBNL. I believe that in the future, seeing how constantly changing the internet has become, data has also become very fluid and that requires us to improve our machine learning techniques to be ready for new data and new patterns without having the time to retrain the models.",Student Success Analytics Platform,"My time at Cal has had many ups and downs which were caused by many factors like being an international student, joining and then leaving greek life, participating in PE classes and also experiencing intense academic pressure in the form of difficult syllabi and intense peer competition.

I also have a strong understanding of machine learning concepts through my experiences in valuing private equity shares and real estate properties. I have used Python TensorFlow and Matlab for creating robust neural networks, regression, classification and clustering algorithms. I also have been studying the differences between different secondary educational systems from a very early age because I was raised in 4 different countries and also because I’m an undergrad at a 5th completely different country.

I started college thinking I was going to be a politician, and I took a semester off freshman year to work on the Clinton campaign in California, Philadelphia, and even in the headquarters in Brooklyn, NY. It was a life-changing, heart-wrenching type experience, and I came out of it with a desire to think differently than I had in the past. At Berkeley, I took CS61A my second semester, and so quickly, I found myself engaging in another style of critical thinking and problem solving. CS clicked for me during the Enigma project, in which we coded the ciphering machine that helped the allied forces break German codes and win the war. It struck me how immediately my work applied to the world around me. At Lark, a healthcare AI company, I used Python to analyze large scale healthcare and financial data, reporting directly to the CEO about my insights on patients' successes, and our ability to optimize their success. I'm incredibly interested in the intersection of data and policy, whether related to technology, global development, healthcare, cybersecurity, and social welfare, and I'm looking forward to learning more. ","Three key goals: 
1. Apply my data science skills to real world endeavors. I'd like to see more clearly the applicability of the academic knowledge in other fields. I think my past experience in politics (at the Hillary campaign), healthcare (at Lark), space (as a NASA datanaut), development classes, and business are mostly sequestered in their own fields. I think the future is interdisciplinary, and Discovery Research seems like great proof of that. 
2. Work with other passionate team members to do something valuable. I'd like to punctuate my Berkeley experience by using my skills in data science, working with other passionate people, to accomplish something useful. 
3. Become familiar with data science for research. I'm still evaluating paths for myself post-graduation, and research has shown that people are very bad judges of predicting what they would like; we only know based on trial and error. I'd like to learn more about data science in research capacities and thus, my future opportunities. ","I think collaboration and mutual exploration is very important to the success of a project. At the beginning of a group project, I always ask the group to set standards for themselves and expectations for others; these may include time investment, community agreements, and more. Furthermore, one of the main functions of team members is their ability to provide advice. I believe it's important to make time to meet in person to discuss milestones, goal setting, and challenges. Communication is the most important aspect of teamwork; I think being clear about roadblocks and issues is critical, and I try my best to be upfront and optimistic. ",Data visualization and analytics for off-grid solar in Africa,"1. My academic coursework greatly matches this project; I am a data science and global development studies major, with experience working in fast moving startups, so I'll be able to hit the ground running. 
2. The tools used in this project are interesting to me, specifically in predicting road and electricity usage, and mapping onto OpenStreetMaps. I'd like to gain more experience using these tools, and I'd love to do while working towards an impactful goal. 
3. I have experience in financial and healthcare portfolio analysis, and I think I could be useful in understanding consumer behavior. It would be very interesting for me to look at the types of purchasing choices made in different geographic and economic regions. I think the project is exciting, and I'd love to be a part of it. ",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"1. I'm a woman in tech that is incredibly invested in promoting other women in tech. I was a Grace Hopper Scholar this year, sponsored by the AnitaB.org, and I found the experience so enlightening. I didn't start college thinking that I would be a technologist; indeed, I boxed myself into humanities fields in high school, and it did take a lot of struggle to fully recognize myself as a technologist. 
2. I'd like answers to the questions proposed about percentages and changes over time of participation of women in tech fields. I'm a data-driven person, and I think it's difficult to make compelling arguments about needed programs supporting women without the requisite data. I'd love to be a part of this effort. 
3. My academic coursework and practical experience fit very well for this project. I'm experienced visualizing data with Tableau and with Python libraries. In past projects, I've used Tableau to visualize the relationship between incarceration and healthcare, based on Cal Policy Lab data; I've also worked on visualization projects as a NASA datanaut, and I've looked at Asian American immigration and life in the SF bay area, based on census records. I have a lot to learn still, for work that will be more generally accessible; and I think this is a great opportunity!
",Sumerian Network Analysis,"1. My academic coursework greatly matches this project; I am a data science and global development studies major, with a concentration in digital humanities. I've taken Professor Lucarelli's course on digital egyptology, and I'm incredibly interested in the study of older civilizations with new techniques. 
2. Network analysis is something that is particularly interesting to me. I think the proposal to use the network of officials, recipients, and delivering agents to visualize the Sumerian city is incredibly exciting. I'm concurrently learning more about network analysis in classes and by self-study; I think the best way to learn is through execution, so this would be a great fit for me.

However, prior the transfer, I took CS, math, and physics classes that really challenged my analytical thinking skills. It helped me excel in liberal arts classes as they also involved critical thinking but in a different way – I loved making thoughtful analysis of iconic movies in my Film class, I was mesmerized by digging into the details of renaissance paintings in the History of Art class, and I felt accomplished writing coherent and articulate texts for my Speech class. The breadth of my academic experience really honed my skills of problem-solving. Also, as I worked in International Students Office at the community college, I learned how to mediate conflicts, provide accurate and detailed solutions to international students, and be a team player. The managers of the office saw my dedication and my ability to work both independently and as part of a group promoted me to the position in which I was also responsible for training new student employees and working with privacy-sensitive documents. This experience also equipped me with a defined sense of responsibility as students, coworkers, and confidential files depended on my actions. ","As most of my experience comes from coursework projects, I am looking for a chance to be challenged to expand my expertise in data analysis and being able to work independently under knowledgable mentorship. In addition, I would like to pick-up new data analysis techniques from the project mentors and the project team mates through cooperation. Lastly, I would like to get insights on how to conduct a proper academic research as I am considering graduate school in the future.","I believe that efficient and productive teamwork requires communication, empathy, and delegation. To me, the communication means listening to each person’s opinion, me being able to express my own opinion, and reaching the consensus through constructive critique and debating. However, the efficient communication is not possible without empathy and acknowledgement of the differences in the backgrounds of the team members – the diversity and the willingness to accept it allows a team to expand the pool of ideas and to produce unique insights. Lastly, delegating the work is crucial for maintaining reasonable and equal load of responsibilities among the team members and ensuring the work is completed according to the time deadlines. ",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"As an avid user of social media and other social online platforms, I am able to recognize the importance of the inclusive cyberspace and that the respective companies must take steps to inspect and regulate the platforms they provide to their users. Through my coursework, I learned the techniques of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning both in Python, and R (and data querying in SQL) that could be applied in this research. I also had the experience of accessing Twitter data through API for one of my academic projects as well as using third party API-accessing tool to export and import data from Salesforce during my internship at Exadel, Inc. Lastly, I have taken a Demography with Data Science class where I teamed up with a project partner to conduct a data analysis research on the topic of government involvement in family planning and its effects on fertility rates in various countries. This experience allowed me to develop an interest in the “people” aspect/focus of data analysis and further improve my research and data manipulation skills.",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,"Through my coursework, I learned the techniques of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning both in Python and R that could be applied in this research. Besides that, I have a passion for helping people – I volunteered as a chaperone on school trips for Educational Talent Search and Upward Bound at Diablo Valley College, I volunteered as a translator at an elementary school, and enjoyed working at International Students Office at DVC where I got to assist international student with their inquiries. Therefore, I aspire to use my skillset and knowledge in the research that would aid people suffering from chronic disease. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"As the cannabis industry is expanding and more states legalize the substance, it is important to regulate its markets as the cannabis tax generates a significant revenue for the states. This further may lead to the legalization in most of the states in US that will benefit a big part of the population. Through my coursework, I learned the techniques of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning both in Python, R, SQL that could be applied in this research. In my ML class IEOR 142, I got familiarized with NLP techniques in R: we performed data cleaning on the text (answers) from StackOverflow to predict whether an askes question regarding a certain topic was deemed useful/relevant by the StackOverflow community. Similarly, I conducted a coursework project in classification of spam and non-spam emails through text analysis with Python and machine learning libraries( e.g.sklearn).

Last year, I created an artificial intelligence startup at UC Berkeley SkyDeck called Ad Launcher, which is funded by UC Berkeley SkyDeck. The goal is to basically optimize the complex parameters of the Google Ads platform using machine learning such that we can easily automate ads for businesses. These parameters involve determining which keywords to use for triggering Google Ads, how to determine price bidding for each keyword based on a monthly budget, and so on. 

From this startup, I learned and taught myself about the latest technologies used in software engineering, machine learning, and entrepreneurship. On the software engineering side, I learned a lot about web frameworks, big data, data engineering, and Cloud Native applications. On the machine learning side, I learned a lot about natural language processing, optimization problems, and Tensorflow. On the entrepreneurship side, I learned how to talk with customers and improved Ad Launcher based on their feedback and provided data. From these different perspectives, data science generally plays a big role into my startup, which is why I love applying and experiencing it.
","I hope to not only gain technical skills in data science such as machine learning, data analysis, and data engineering techniques but I also want to gain experience in communicating my perspective on data throughout my research. Specifically, I want to be able to express my thoughts, interpretation, and application of the data I am working with more clearly to people. This is because data is crucial in making something succeed or grow. Because of this, I want to make an impact with the data I work, which is the most important thing I want to gain as a data scientist participating in Discovery Research.","Communication and organization are the two significant factors of a successful teamwork. In my startup, I have to deal with a lot of chaos in my work, which allowed me to learn how to make teamwork successful. I do it in several steps. I establish meetings with my team at least once or twice a week to keep communication in touch. In those meetings, I have each team member discuss good and bad aspects about their progress in their portion of the project, which keeps things organized. From there, we as a team help resolve each other's obstacles. That's how I approach teamwork in a realistic manner.",Dispatcher algorithm,"I love these optimization problems like dispatching algorithms and the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) because they are super practical for day-to-day situations. I have heuristically solved a similiar kind of problem that is a mix of dispatching optimization and the Travelling Salesman Problem, which was super fun to solve. The problem is defined as the following:

Given that you have people at your house, you want to drop them off but you are lazy to drop off every single person to their home. Instead, you want to set drop-off locations such that you can drop off multiple people and let them walk of on their own. 

To solve this problem, I did fun research on dispatching and TSP algorithms. After I found which heuristic algorithms, I performed a reduction on the problem to allow me to apply the algorithms, which was mind-blowing to me. I want to apply what I learned from this experience to figure out how we can optimize the Kiwi Mate and robot assignation when receiving real-time orders and learn a lot from what I research and apply. This is an area of interest where I would like to do a lot of fun experiments with dispatching algorithms and also learn how I can apply theory to real life scenarios.",Kiwibot delivery robots,"I love making prediction models that are practical in real scenarios. I have done a similar project where I predicted the duration of taxi rides in New York City. There were multiple components to this project: exploratory data analysis, modeling, and optimization. Each of these components were really fun to go through and each tackled a different kind of thinking. 

In exploratory data analysis, I discovered the underlying trends of the taxi rides where the fares had a strong association with duration. I also used geographical heat maps and found that dense areas were associated with duration, which was fun and beautiful. These findings were crucial and important to creating the models, which was fun.

In modeling and optimization, I decided to go with linear regression with L2 regularization since I discovered that the weights of the model were extremely large. L2 regularization helped me reduce the weights and made my linear regression model much more accurate.

It was interesting to learn the optimization and regularization techniques I needed to ensure my model was good to predict taxi durations. Overall, these concepts are applicable to this project and I have really high interests in going through the journey of creating a prediction model that will make Kiwibot customers happy. I look forward to try out new techniques.",Data Enabled Donations,"I participated with a team in an IBM Hackathon that involved solving problems relating to disasters. In researching ways to improve community resilience to a disaster, our team found that communication and collaboration were key to saving lives. We found that there was no worldwide, uniting platform for disaster response. Our project, criSys, was designed to run as a scalable web application which would be easy to use, and unite across all boundaries, with a vision to replace old-fashioned systems and even work offline for applicable use cases (such as local communications). Solving a problem related to disaster was very fun to tackle as a software developer. As a data scientist, I am interested in doing similar in this project and I love to apply my optimization skills to figure out how to optimize the supply and demand of physical donations that shelters receive following a disaster.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,My friends who are in the Discovery Program told me to try this out. :),No,1,

I want to explore how I can use computer science to better what we know now. Something I've always wanted to eventually learn and explore is machine learning and how we can use it to enhance human analysis of data. 
Beyond Cal, I am a K-12 tutor for students in the Berkeley area and I work with them to improve their executive function skills as well as subject specific help. I really enjoy working with my students and paying attention to their differences to see how I can better support them.","I really want to explore the real life applications of what I'm learning in class. I definitely want to be doing something that allows me to explore myself academically and also provide a bridge between the side of me that is still interested in medicine and computer science. I hope to finally have the chance to explore the intersection between medicine and computer science and see how we can improve medicine. I'm interested in exploring AI and machine learning and since I learn best through practice and application, I think that the Data Science Discovery Program can provide me a great opportunity to expand on my current skills as well as learning new skills.","I think collaboration is a very important part of doing anything. I am a tutor for K-12 students and I work with a team of administrators, the student's parents, teachers, and the student to create a customized learning plan for my students. The most important part of this loop is fielding feedback and improving from that. 
An important part of teamwork is striking a delicate balance between individuality while working with others and keeping them in mind. It's important to be headstrong and have initiative but never disregarding others' opinions and feedback and most importantly know and be okay with asking for help when needed.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"This project allows me to explore the intersection in medicine and computer science and also allows me to explore my interest in artificial intelligence. Prior to switching to computer science, I was a premed student but I was also always fascinated by technology and how it is slowly making itself more prominent in medicine and how it enhanced the state of our medical field. I want to finally be able to do something that actually explores this intersection since there aren’t many labs at Berkeley or classes that explore this. 
I learn best by doing and I believe that this project will allow me to further the skills I already have now as well as help me learn quite a few more. Hopefully I’ll be able to contribute something that will impact many others beneficially. ",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"I enjoyed chemistry all throughout high school and even now I still do and continue tutoring chemistry students. At Cal, I discovered that I enjoyed its physical aspects much more than the organic. Taking on this project from a more technical aspect will allow me to look at chemistry from a different perspective. It will also help me build a bridge between all the chemistry I studied and the computer science that I am moving forward with now. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I’ve always been a bit fascinated by cancer ever since I was in middle school. I was intrigued by the idea that our bodies could make such mistakes; I’ve always wondered why some cancers are caught early while others wreak havoc without us knowing until it is too late. I think this project is particularly interesting because it explores an overlooked part of the diagnosis. Doctors draw conclusions from the data that they receive and often times, it is the doctor that is blamed for an ill informed diagnoses but we rarely consider the data that they receive. The project does not seek to replace the human aspect of medicine but rather tries to enhance our human abilities and personally I think that’s something that is very important to consider in a world that’s always technologically advancing.",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,EOP,Looking through Berkeley research opportunities,No,1,

As most avid basketball fans would tell you, statistics can convey a story about what a player’s style of play is – particularly where their strengths and deficiencies lie, and how those have changed over time. Recently, the NBA has gone through an analytics movement in which coaching staffs have realized that they can use the substantial amount of data collected to guide their reasoning on which shots are most optimal and how they can cater to their players’ strengths. This movement has been very exciting for me because my passion for math has intersected with my passion for basketball. Clearly, there is an increasing opportunity to use the mathematical reasoning developed in my math and CS classes to aggregate data and present it in a way that can be useful for the context that I am in. The example used above of basketball can obviously be extended to a variety of more impactful settings and is the reason why I am so excited about this growing field of study. ","Through class projects I have learned about and implemented techniques such as Bayesian inference, reinforcement learning, and neural nets. Additionally, I will be taking a course on ML this semester. Through the Discovery program I hope to expand on my understanding from the classroom by observing how top researchers leverage these techniques in meaningful settings. As a student who has never participated in university-level research before, I believe that I have a lot to gain in terms of understanding how elite researchers think and go about seeking and testing new information. This experience will undoubtedly benefit me for the rest of my life, regardless of whether I ultimately choose to go into academia. Moreover, UC Berkeley happens to be one of the best research universities in the world – especially for data science – so I will be guided by people that have a passion for and excel in what they do. The projects that I am interested in are cutting-edge and impactful, so I would be more than happy to involve myself in the process and contribute as much as I can. I have barely scratched the surface of data science so far and hope to learn much more through this exciting program. ","I believe that a crucial component of effective teamwork is clearly defined responsibilities and objectives. Especially in a place like Berkeley, most people are passionate and motivated for what they do. Therefore, if every team member understands exactly what is needed of them and by when, they will find a way to accomplish it. For this to occur, team leads must be able to communicate their vision and members must be able to listen intently and ask questions where anything is potentially unclear. As an undergraduate student, my responsibility will be the latter. I pride myself on being a good listener and being able to follow direction, so these skills will be especially valuable as a member of a research project. I have also never been shy to ask questions in the classroom when needed, so I will need to continue to do this as I enter an unfamiliar domain. Lastly, in order to truly be an asset to my team, it is important that I take initiative when it is appropriate to do so. An authentic and worthwhile experience will likely involve searching for answers on my own and making some decisions without having my hand held, so I will need to tackle that head-on. ",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"This project is the right fit for me because it expands on what I have learned regarding conventional ways in which machine learning is used. In class, I have learned in detail about how we can represent data as feature vectors and learn using these vectors, but I have never been exposed to these techniques as they pertain to graph-based data structures. After reading this project idea, it’s a very logical progression from traditional ML and I’m amazed as to how I have never thought about this. The potential impact of this project is very clear, as we would be able to more accurately represent a large class of datasets and therefore allow the machine learning performed on these datasets to be more effective. Being a part of this project would allow me to tackle what I have learned in class in much greater depth and would give me the opportunity to acquire knowledge that I would not be able to gain elsewhere. ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"This project is the right fit for me because it provides an opportunity to apply the streaming techniques that I have learned in classes such as CS 170 (Algorithms) to real world examples that are meaningful to me. One of the main reasons why I study computer science is because it is applicable to so many different contexts and finance is no exception. It has become increasingly clear that with the vast amount of data available to the financial world, being able to process it efficiently and observe trends is a highly valuable skill. While much of the CS curriculum in the classes I have taken have focused on databases, not much have focused on real world implementations of techniques used to analyze streams of data. Consequently, I believe that being a part of this project would be a very useful experience and would allow me to acquire a significant amount knowledge that I would not be able to gain elsewhere. Overall, the project is relevant to what I am interested in and expands on what I have learned so far.",NASA data viz,"This project is the right fit for me because it provides an opportunity to apply the techniques learned in my Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning classes to a meaningful project in which the dataset is more varied. Particularly, interpreting the simulator log files, eye tracking data, and manual annotations, and linking them together to predict certain behaviors would be a completely new challenge for me. Figuring out how to handle these different data types in the same environment will be an interesting process and will undoubtedly be a valuable experience for the future. Especially since real world datasets are much closer in representation to this project than to what I have seen in the classroom, I’m sure that I will learn many things that I will appreciate later on. Additionally, my experience with python gives me a basis to understand where the project is currently at and how specifically I can contribute to its progress.

I entered Cal a wide-eyed student with a passion for a variety of subjects. I often wondered where I could fulfill all my different aspirations, as choosing a single major seemed too limiting for everything I wanted to learn. I still have this passion for knowledge, and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to grow.","I wish to gain further insight into a hands-on workspace involving data science. While classes are very interesting, I have often wondered where the classroom and 'real-world' intersect. I would love to gain experience and insight into building, data analysis, and working in a team with other passionate peers.","In my opinion, teamwork is crucial to productivity-- everyone brings something different to a team. I try my best to approach teamwork with an open mind; although I may not always agree with those on my team, they often make me stronger as a person.",Kiwibot delivery robots,"As an avid user of Kiwibot, I've always been interested in the 'behind-the-scenes' development, and greatly enjoyed Kiwi's CES 2020 showcase. I would greatly enjoy the opportunity to be involved in the further development of Kiwibots, and hope to see them thrive on the Cal campus (especially as they are an iconic part of campus culture). I fully believe that Kiwi is the best for campus delivery, and would appreciate the chance to be involved in development of a dispatcher algorithm or delivery time estimation. ",Data for Social Good,"We hear the word 'data' tossed around in a negative light more often than not in recent times, and unfortunately many corporations have utilized big data to perpetuate racism, sexism, and propaganda. As an aspiring Data and Cognitive Scientist, I want to help change the perception of data and turn it into a tool for good. I hope to be able to participate in the equalizing the playing field and use of data to support marginalized communities, especially when we need it now more than ever. ",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"Our planet has become increasingly polluted in recent years, and it is urgent that we work towards change.

I never experienced stereotypes or racism before, so hearing Asian jokes for months after that day led me to isolate myself due to my insecurities ― my accent, appearance, and lack of confidence. Even at home, I kept these issues to myself because I wanted to face this cultural barrier without worrying my mother, who was already working 84-hour weeks to build a foundation for our new lives. I didn’t know how to belong. Fortunately, my path towards acceptance unknowingly began when I got my first laptop for Christmas.      
                                          
I found a means of positively channeling the pressure, frustration, and negativity I felt through watching YouTube. I still felt trapped and judged by my peers, but I discovered an outlet to escape the real world briefly. When the Asian YouTubers I followed began creating “#DrawMyLife” videos, highlighting their experiences and struggles growing up in America, I realized that I shared similar experiences with these people and felt inspired. Seeing how their lives changed positively and tremendously once they overcame their roadblocks, I learned that taking away the feeling of empowerment and gratification is the only way to deal with stereotypes and racial discrimination. By stop letting negativity affect me, I felt a great sense of relief from the pressure of being myself. I began to excel in my ESL classes and exited the program after sixth grade, two years early. I became more comfortable talking with people, which improved my accent and social life. I grew from a kid full of insecurities into an emotionally mature person who could handle adversities in a positive manner. 

After overcoming my fears, I learned to be adaptable to change and overcome obstacles, which prepared me for the challenges I will encounter in my journey through life and academia.","Through participating in Discovery Research, I wish to gain exposure to and apply what I have learned in the classroom to a real-life project as a glimpse of  what I would potentially being doing in my professional career. By challenging myself in a new environment and picking the brains of those around me, my goal is to become a better individual through learning new knowledge, becoming a better team player, and giving back to the Berkeley community that has taught me so much in my time at the university. ","At age eleven, basketball became my favorite sport. I started playing more competitively in high school and was promoted to JV during freshman year. That summer, however, the new head coach required every player to participate in summer league and practices ― for him, only going to tryouts shows lack of commitment. Though I gave up basketball to begin working due to limited financial means, basketball remained my passion. I was never the most athletic nor skilled, but I learned resiliency and played hard to involve teammates. Through basketball, I found my strength ― promoting teamwork to draw out individuals’ best traits and promote group success. 

I was taught to never let limitations define me. With financial instability depriving me of my passion, I aspired to be the voice of guidance and support that I never had, which led me to coach basketball at my former middle school.  Having been in their shoes, this experience put me in the position to positively influence the youth, which expanded my perspectives on what great leadership entails. It’s more than just giving orders: being a role model, coach, and mentor requires addressing the needs of those who rely on your guidance to make them better athletes and people. Apart from privately tutoring some of the kids I coached in math and Spanish, I often discussed and offered guidance regarding issues that hinder children like family and social problems. I encouraged my team to embrace teamwork and sportsmanship because it shows mutual respect and the potential to enhance a team’s efficiency. These qualities, I explained, play important roles in developing relationships and careers later in life as people judge you based on your composure and your effects on your peers. 

By focusing on individual growth, I’ve worked and connected well with the youth to form a supportive environment, resulting in three winning-seasons, one of which was undefeated. I learned to use adversity as motivation for self-improvement and became a support system for young people. Most importantly, I gained and sharpened valuable skills to inspire people and create positive change in the community.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"Cannabis is a growing market in the United States as it is becoming more accepted socially and legally. As more companies are investing in this rapidly growing industry, I find it important to analyze and understand the general trends and patterns in product description data, which could potentially reveal underlying reasons that affect the market competition in the cannabis industry. Furthermore, I have had experience with cleaning messy and unstructured datasets to analyze and visualize different patterns in patients' data through my internship at Anthem Blue Cross. I also would like to practice and improve my programming skills working on a project that I am genuinely interested in. I have friends and acquaintances that are working in this industry from the research and entrepreneurial standpoints. Thus, I find it extremely interesting to see the cannabis industry from the analytical standpoint, that may give me a different perspective on a profitable and competitive industry like cannabis.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"My grandmother passed away when my father was a child due to cardiac arrest. In turn, my father inherited the same genes from her and is predisposed to cardiovascular disease as well. Growing up, I always feared that I would also have the same health issues as those in my family, leading me to take exercising very seriously. Learning more of what this project entails struck my interests as I have always wanted to do something that contributes to the efforts of improving early detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease. 

I have had some exposure to machine learning techniques and concepts through the classes I took at Cal. I also have had experience working with medical data through my internship at Anthem Blue Cross last summer. When combined with my curiosity toward machine learning and work ethic, I believe that I would make a great candidate to work on this project as I wish to challenge myself to grow as a student and as an individual, working on a project that I am genuinely interested in and excited to learn new knowledge.",,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,"EOP, Summer Bridge",Berkeley email,N/A,1,

After taking Data 8 my freshman year and completing a finance and data analytics internship with a software development company, ON24, I found that I was very interested in learning more about data science. I have taken classes involving coding in Matlab and Python. Outside of Data science, I am interested in most maths, particularly statistics and probability, as well as business and economics. Outside of academics, I have been very involved in nonprofit and community development work: planning fundraising events for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, helping run the Karishma Project, which aids survivors of domestic violence in India, participating in Engineers without Borders Panama Water Project where I work with collected data to develop community surveys, and joining the ASUC Student Government where I am working to improve student academic experiences.","Through participating in Discovery Research, I hope to gain experience with real-life applications of data science. I understand a lot about how to code in python and have worked with hypothetical data sets in classes, but I would love to contribute to a team’s work and in the process, learn more about data manipulation and application to systems around us.","I have worked on many different teams throughout internships, clubs, and classes. My approach is to work collaboratively but divide up work for efficiency. I have found that it is good if, in a team, each individual is able to focus their time on making one part of the project the best it can be. When coming back together, getting input from others on the work previously done is often helpful in bridging all parts of the project together. I am always prepared to hear the opinions of all members of a team, as I believe that the best solution can never be found without hearing all perspectives in a room. I have always enjoyed working in groups, as it allows me to develop my ideas with the help and support of the ideas of others around me.",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"I am very interested in being a part of the streaming data analysis team. I would love to learn more about the technology behind data streaming, as I believe the future of data science is in real time machine learning techniques that enable further development of AI. As I learn more through my Industrial Engineering & Operations Research classes about network flows, optimization, and supply chain concepts, I become more eager to investigate the applications of such ideas in regards to the generation of information from thousands of different data sources.
	I became very interested in financial data sets when I completed a finance internship for ON24, Inc. last year. I was tasked with analyzing Salesforce data sets and completing bookings and campaign data analysis. There was a limit to the extent I was able to learn about the company because of the discrete data presented through past reports; I would very much enjoy seeing the opposite in this project with continuous data in financial applications.",NASA data viz,"I would love to be a part of the NASA Data Visualization team. Compiling and manipulating various sources of data to make predictions about flight behavior is a great learning experience to see the future of modern simulation technology. As I learn more through my Industrial Engineering & Operations Research classes about statistics, network flows, and optimization of systems, I am very eager to see how events are translated into coding and into data sets that can be analyzed to improve behavior prediction. Stepping into this project will allow me to learn about something outside of my comfort zone but will teach me tools that I will be able to apply in the future to any field I choose. I am extremely interested in the goals of this project and I think that my background in IEOR will be helpful in analyzing multiple layers of information the team collects.",Dispatcher algorithm,"Everyone at Cal knows and loves Kiwi bots, and I am no exception. To be able to work on the Kiwi bot dispatcher algorithm would be incredible, as I would be able to combine my passion for the Kiwi delivery service with my interests in data science. As I learn more through my Industrial Engineering & Operations Research classes about statistics, network flows, optimization, and supply chain concepts, I become more eager to investigate the applications of such ideas in systems I pass by every day. And I would love to pass by Kiwi bots on my way to class knowing I am helping to contribute to improved user experience for students around me. It would be interesting to see how we can use data regarding orders to predict the fastest delivery methods; my major is meant to investigate exactly how systems such as the Kiwi bot system can be optimized.",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Discovery Research, Fall 2019","Yes: Upswot, Fall 2019",None,Participation last semester,n/a,1,

I always wanted to connect it to the world around me. Throughout high school, I fostered an interest in using my web development skills to solve the issues I saw in my community. In doing so, I discovered a passion for applying technology for the benefit of society. However, when I entered college, I had the opportunity to take classes on the way technology and society interact (Engineering, Environment and Society/Human Contexts and Ethics of Data), which led me to an interest in public policy and social organizing. 

Although many of my classes are technical as an engineer, I make an effort to be engaged in the social sector outside of class. This has primarily been my work with The Berkeley Group, a pro-bono consulting organization for nonprofits. For two semesters, I have worked with two different nonprofits on marketing and branding strategies, along with a program expansion strategy on my most recent project. Being able to hear from nonprofits about the difference our work has made has been an incredibly fulfilling experience for me. In addition to The Berkeley Group, I also had the opportunity to be involved in another social justice project, as part of my Engineering, Environment, and Society class, in which I created a documentary and audio-walking tour to preserve the cultural history of the Richmond Greenway. I eventually hope to combine my passions and use my technical skills as an engineer to foster social and environmental justice. ","Through the Discovery Research program, I hope to be able to get more hands-on programming experience in a project setting. In several of my classes, I thoroughly enjoyed working on data science projects, which has driven me to want to work on more complex and rigorous projects. In addition, the discovery research program has many socially beneficial projects, and I hope to gain experience in applying my programming skills to serve a larger social cause. Mainly, I strive to gain a deeper understanding of what data science work in a real-world project looks like-- with its social context as well as technical challenges. Besides advancing my technical skills, I hope to be able to work with other students that are passionate about data science, as well as learn from colleagues and mentors. ","I have worked in many team environments, from high school and throughout college. My most recent and rewarding team experiences have been in The Berkeley Group, where we work for the duration of a semester in a team of six on a single project. With the two projects I have worked on, I have been able to learn a great deal about working successfully in a team environment. My main approach to teamwork is clear and constant communication, which can be fostered through consistent meetings, and a standard online communication tool (Slack, FB Messenger, etc.). I have also learned that teamwork is most effective when individual tasks are assigned, and the team comes together periodically to share individual progress, as well as give and receive feedback. Team culture is crucial to a successful team environment-- it is important that each member feels valuable and that roles do not overstep each other. Members must be friendly and respectful, and each team member must believe every other team member is capable of their job. ",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"I became interested in environmental justice when I took the course, Engineering, Environment and Society my first year. During the class, I was able to work on a project where we created a documentary and audio walking tour of the story behind the Richmond Greenway. In the project, I was able to learn about the ways the Richmond community members were working to fight for environmental justice. In the class itself, we worked with many pollutant maps with demographic breakdowns that allowed us to truly understand what environmental justice was about. However, it was speaking to the Richmond community members that allowed me to recognize the power this kind of data can have in helping foster the health and well being of real people. 

This project interests me because of the possibility that I could contribute to an eye-opening map that provides crucial data to policymakers. Technology is a powerful source of transparency into the ways that harmful environmental factors are present in POC and low-income communities. Although this injustice is constructed through a history of systemic discrimination, data such as the Environmental Justice Mapping Project can be a way to powerful way to allow for real change in policy, which will eventually lead to the protection of these very communities. As an engineer, I hope to use my technical skills to fight towards social and environmental justice through a project like this. ",Computational Analysis of Charter School Identities and Stratification,"Segregation in schools is something that has been institutionally ingrained into our American education system, and it is something that we must work very hard to remove. The education system is complex-- and creating equal educational opportunity for all students regardless of skin color or economic background has proven a mighty challenge systematically across the United States. There has been speculation in recent years that Charter Schools could be a source of maintaining the structures of oppression that have existed since lawful segregation. This project, to me, means using the power of technology to demystify the complex American education system and observe the true impact on students through programs such as charter schools, which is key to seeking equal opportunity in American education. Being able to use technology to figure this out is something that really motivates and excites me. Ever since I took the Engineering, Environment, and Society class, I have been interested in using my technical skills towards social and environmental justice. This is this kind of project that would allow me to explore tough societal questions through unquestionable data and numbers. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"Tackling youth homelessness is a complex societal issue, and we must find a way to create policies that are effective at providing shelter, financial resources, and health services to young people. Throughout history, many policies have been ineffective at helping this vulnerable population, which is why I believe in this project as a key informative tool for policymakers and social service providers. With this data set, we would be able to see what really keeps young people experiencing homelessness safe, and use that to make more informed, effective laws and programs. The prospect of this data set being the source of real change for vulnerable populations is what really motivated me to apply for this opportunity. As an engineer, I hope to eventually be able to use my problem-solving skills to create social change and serve underserved communities. A project like this is an incredible opportunity to utilize the problem solving skills I am building in school towards doing real social sector work.

I was born in Seattle, Washington and moved to the Bay Area where I’ve been since kindergarten. I’m passionate about tech, but Data Science was never really in my major plans until the second semester of my freshman year at Berkeley. Right now as an excited data and computer science novice, I’m challenging myself to explore the growing field of data science and intersections between the two majors. One way I’ve been trying to get involved is by seeking teaching opportunities from my completed courses. I have been an Academic Intern for three of my past courses and will be a tutor in the upcoming spring semester. Teaching is an enjoyable outlet for me to help others grow as well as teach myself important soft skills like communication and collaboration. Outside of academics, I spend my time working on small projects with friends or by myself. Last summer, a group of friends and I came together to create a black jack simulator. This greatly improved my ability to code from scratch with others and gave me insight on the functions of a working team. Overall, as I progress through college, I continue to seek challenging environments where I can push myself to learn new concepts as well as apply the skills I have learnt before. ","I wish to gain important skills and techniques associated with research. Discovery Research allows me to gain the experience of contributing to a large scale project using statistical concepts, data science libraries, and problem solving skills I’ve learned from my courses. I also want to be part of a team that accomplishes a project that could have a big impact on the broader community. I really want to gain the opportunity to work on research with experienced individuals and learn from their expertise. For me, this program is an opportunity for me to step outside the academic field and learn how to connect theory with real-world applications. Ultimately, I want to come out of the program with experience in concepts I’m not familiar with, a better understanding of how research in data science works, and the invaluable experience of working on a project that impacts the larger audience.","My approach to teamwork relies heavily on open communication channels that will ensure that tasks are spread and completed efficiently. In my experience, I’ve realized that clear responsibilities and deadlines help team members understand the direction and pace of the project. This allows work to be done independently or in a team,  contributing to the overall efficiency of the project. More importantly, communication develops a safe environment for others to work in. I’ve found that my more communicative teams tend to be closer to each other and get more work done. Overall, I would say my approach to teamwork means I am consistently communicating with my team members to understand what work needs to be done.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"From the description, I feel like this project is a good fit for my technical interests as well as a great opportunity for me to experience how research is done. Therefore, being part of this project would be a huge learning experience for me. It provides me with all the resources that will help me achieve what I set out to gain through the Discovery Program. The task is a challenge and completely new to me and therefore, I’m excited to learn more and potentially be part of it. Not only that, but it has important connections to pharmaceutical applications that impacts the broader community. The software being used is in line with what I’m familiar with. I’ve had experience working in python and the basic machine learning libraries. This project will give me the opportunity I’ve been seeking to expand my knowledge in the field of machine learning as well as sharpen my skills in python. Also, the optimization aspect is in line with my current academic interests. Overall, I’m seeking a challenging task, motivated team, and opportunities to potentially make an impact on a larger community. I believe this project provides me with all those aspects.

Too often have I come in with my own set of expectations and predictions of how something will go, only to be completely blindsided by something out of my perception. Recently, I have become to embrace these surprises rather than fear them. For me, expectation implies that there is a tangible goal meant to be reached through my efforts. However, failure to reach said goals can be crushing and dissuade future attempts. Allowing myself to let go of those expectations and be open to anything that may happen has given me not only a sense of relief but a greater urge to learn rather than avoid. Growing up has burdened with me many responsibilities, some I was unsure if I was ready to face, but this mindset has tremendously helped me tackle them.  ","My hope is that I gain a better sense of application through participation within the Discovery Research. Currently, I have taken numerous classes dissecting the various facets of the Data Science field, from probability theory to the ethics of data science practices. I have been longing for an opportunity to finally take this knowledge and apply it to a tangible goal or effort within the confines of the living world. In addition, I would love to have the chance to use this research opportunity to help me begin thinking of some research topics for my own independent research. Hopefully, I could even start my own research project by learning from those far more experienced than I am.","My approach to teamwork heavily prioritizes communication before anything else. First, I take a substantial amount of time to analyze the problem. While taking the first step is important, it is critical that the first step is also the right step to avoid further complications. There have been many instances where I have dived headfirst into a problem without fully comprehending it. Next, I try to coordinate which tasks should go to who based on strengths and weaknesses. It helps to take some time to just get to know your teammates outside of the project being worked on. Building camaraderie as friends leads to much stronger teamwork dynamic. Finally, it is important to emphasize the constant flow of communication to help avoid any setbacks in progress. The all too familiar rush of crunch time can be stressful but that difficulty can be alleviated when all members of the team are working in tandem, which is only possible through reliable communication.  ",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"As a student interested in pursuing law in the future, I have always wondered what applications of data science could be applied to the legal field. I believe that data science provides a strong tool for understanding the various patterns and trends within our legal system and I would love the opportunity to help explore those patterns and trends. Seeing the data and decisions that factor in Supreme Court decisions to see which cases to take can point to issues that are being weighed heavier than others. Comparing current administration choices with past administrations can show whether the Supreme Court remains constant in its decisions or whether it follows different trajectories. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"When I took Sociology 3AC last semester, I explored the various gaps in academic success across racial and class divisions. This is incredibly intriguing to me since I went on to write a paper that compared my own public school with various schools in the area and founding striking differences despite being located within the same county. I would love to further examine this through the research project. I have also been incredibly invested in helping further educational growth for others, having worked at a teaching center years ago. I firmly believe that education is a national issue and must be at the forefront of legislative issues. By observing data within the Berkeley Public Schools, I hope that we can give lawmakers better data to work with and help implement solutions that are sorely needed.

Thus, I’m constantly seeking to expand my knowledge beyond the fields of study I eventually chose, data science and business. Most recently, I’ve been learning about investing after getting a taste in finance last semester. As I have learned more about the world, I find myself wanting to use that knowledge to take action in my life and positively impact others. 
 
I joined a food justice consulting club to help solve problems for companies who aim to make the food space more sustainable and equitable. For example, I have conducted food waste research with Copia, a software-based startup that connects excess food from restaurants to non-profits. I have also enjoyed immersion in educational spaces as a Data 8 tutor, literacy mentor for elementary school students, and involvement in CalTeach. Likewise, I’m interested in using data science skills to produce insights and create change/research on social topics. Thus, I want to pair my data skills with academic knowledge in subjects like public policy and social welfare next! ","With Discovery Research, I’m excited to collaborate with leading researchers and faculty who have a vision of what they want to accomplish with the help of data-driven practices. I’m eager for the opportunity to learn something new or explore something more deeply under the tutelage of experts in their respective fields. Likewise, I want to challenge myself to manage uncertainty when dealing with real-life, messy data and work through problems that may not have known answers. This type of holistic data science process provides an opportunity for tremendous growth in my data science, teamwork, and problem solving skills. And as mentioned in the first prompt, I also want to generate change and impact on meaningful projects through the skills I’ve learned in my data science classes. Thus, I believe participation in the Discovery Research program provides an awesome opportunity to connect my purpose with my abilities. ","My vision of a team is a group of people working in sync towards a common goal whose individual ideas/contributions are respected, valued, and encouraged. Teams often have a mix of personalities, skills, and tendencies. Often in team meetings, individuals who are comfortable speaking out loud tend to dominate the thinking and direction of the team. Effective teams find a way to empower both the loud and more reserved individuals, while discovering how to complement the talents of each member into a cohesive whole. 

A way I tried to discourage group-think in a leadership capacity is providing the opportunity for everyone to write down their thoughts to prompts on sticky notes. After giving ample time for brainstorming, each person would stick their notes onto a whiteboard and we would identify themes, unique points, and differences among everyone’s ideas. Thus, I tried to ensure everyone’s voice was heard by reducing the barriers to entry and making it more comfortable to contribute. I believe strategies like this can help people take greater ownership of a project and feel more invested in its success!",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"When I was a literacy mentor for elementary school students in Oakland, I worked with youth who approached mentoring with a willingness to try, fail, and learn despite reading far below grade level. As I invested more time into these students, I saw their literacy blossom - in addition to their personal confidence and sense of expression. Similarly, I want to advocate for youth suffering from violence and homelessness. Like my students, I believe these youth deserve the opportunities and care needed to position themselves for future success.  

This project provides an opportunity to realize that purpose by creating an accessible database for policymakers and social service providers to help prevent violence against youth. I believe this project is also unique for its approach - it requires tremendous creativity and collaboration to merge diverse types of data (geographic, qualitative, etc.) into effective consolidation for analysis. While not deeply familiar with the nuances of the different data types, I believe I have the problem-solving and data perspectives necessary to take on such design challenges. Thus, I’m excited to potentially collaborate with SF-Yeah and use data-driven practices to deploy tools to help youth suffering through incredible hardships. ",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"The Internet has revolutionized how humans talk with one another - easing communication friction and connecting individuals around the globe in seconds. It has also produced unintended consequences such as radicalizing individuals to commit unprecedented hate crimes. Similarly, I noticed how commonly I saw people talking past one another and not with each other on Facebook. That's why I decided to write my final paper for my technology ethics class on what steps Facebook can take to curb group-think and political bubbles. Likewise, I have great interest in this project to analyze how we can reverse these trends and uplift communication in this digital age. 

Similarly, I believe in the transformative power of the Internet to catalyze personal growth, incredible learning, and meaningful friendships. Figuring out what language encourages these processes through data-driven practices such as text analysis and natural language processing is an awesome task. Thus, I’m excited to potentially collaborate with researchers/experts to produce scalable methodology and make headway towards deciphering inclusive speech on the Internet. ",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"With IoT infrastructure growing larger and larger, it’s great to see innovative startups like Clarity using such technology to gather air quality data and inform policies regarding environmental sustainability. With advanced air sensing monitors, quick installation time, and a cloud ecosystem, Clarity can effectively leverage data from thousands of different sources to drive customized action for specific communities. As this data is collected, I see an awesome opportunity to collaborate with Clarity to explore the insights and stories this data has to offer. I envision potential applications of this data as holding businesses accountable to air pollution standards, identifying anomalies in the emissions space, and identifying what leading sustainable cities are doing well. I’m excited to see how Clarity starts to democratize information through the lens of data. Informing citizens and customers of environmental realities is crucial in this era of rapid climate change.

If I am not outdoors you will most likely find me watching documentaries or reading another article about one Elon’s bizarre business ventures. I focused a lot of my time in high school taking rigorous STEM coursework and transitioning those skills to an entrepreneurial or business setting whether that be the tutoring business I set up, DECA with a 30 page business study, or at a hackathon. I am always looking to expand my skill set and am always curious which is why I chose to come to Berkeley. I have enjoyed the atmosphere and meeting such intellectual students through my consulting club and internship at Skydeck and look forward to partaking in more experiences like this discovery program this upcoming semester.","I have been very excited with my choice to pursue Data Science from the moment I came to Berkeley primarily for the community. The Data Science department has already become such an established group in such a short time span and its combinations of professors and faculty from various majors and departments still remains the roots of its continued success and growth. From the minute I came to the info session during cal day I knew this was what I wanted to major in because of this community. And I believe this discovery program will allow me to better utilize this community. Working on a research project with a graduate student would not only allow me to further expand my experience with the concepts obtained from the curriculum I am learning, but also allow me to further invest myself into the data science community and take advantage of all the resources it has to offer. I have already found so much use in meeting with upper classmen in the major, talking with professors during office hours, and learning more about my opportunities with the counselors which I hope to continue doing if given an opportunity to be a part of this program.","I have always seen teamwork as cornerstone of all success. It gives everyone a chance to bring to the table their brightest and unique skills for the benefit of the team and offer new and differing perspectives that no single individual could think to have. Teamwork allows students like myself to even bring to the table something as similar as energy and curiosity which carries a huge role in productivity of a team. I personally love the horizontal structure of team and I have implemented this structure in my past experiences as president of both DECA and National Honor Society. Empowering all teammates by giving everyone equal say and authority not only boosts team involvement and commitment, but it makes for a more cohesive environment. Another thing I love being is both the head of a team and a general teammate because I feel there are important skills to garner from both positions. As a general teammate you can learn from the higher members as they have a lot of experience and can be a great mentor. I also believe however that once you have developed skills you can truly master them by involving and teaching others to achieve truly significant work.",Student Success Analytics Platform,I find this project very interesting because of how applicable my view can influence the development of this analytics platform being a student. I can not only use my current status as a student to make the platform more including of all variables at play as well as directly benefit from results of this project. In my current internship at SkyDeck I have worked on multivariate regression and decision trees which are both very useful for this project and have given me introductory knowledge  to handle the tasks required by this project. Overall I think it is just a very neat concept and could help a lot of students and I would be able to directly see my impact!,Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"Being a business minded person I find this project very intriguing.

The word ‘coding’ was a stranger to me until my curiosity led me to take CS61A. After moving to America at the age of 4, all my life I lived in rural Northern California in a town called Yreka with ~7,500 people, a population with little to no diversity; I was one of the only Asians growing up. Opportunities were scarce in my rural county and many advanced courses/extracurriculars such as science and technology were not offered in my high school. I did everything I could, seeking out opportunities for myself to get to college, while helping out at my parents’ restaurant. With a high school teaching only the basics, I jumped at every opportunity to maximize my knowledge; I was strongly interested in the sciences and mathematics. After taking 61A at Berkeley, I discovered a whole new world and I since then have admired its ability in creating new technologies and usefulness in gaining information. I also seek to broaden my experiences outside of academics such as hiking and snowboarding. I will continue to pursue and learn new experiences. ","Unlike some students, I did not discover computer/data science until I came to Berkeley. As a result, I feel a bit behind compared to my peers and I fear this disadvantage will give me less opportunities in getting accepted to certain related programs/clubs. However, I will not shy away from learning more about computer/data science. I am an extremely hard worker and I am a fast learner. From this research program, I hope to be introduced to the impact of data science and gain more knowledge on its applications. I want to later apply the skills I learn into the biotechnology world and use its data analysis to produce more results. I really would like to participate in Discover Research as it is a pathway for me to really get to learn the applications of data science and its significance. ","I believe teamwork is required for any large goal or task to be successfully completed. The major approach to teamwork is communication and leadership. Every teammate’s ideas are valid and often times multiple minds operating is better than just one. It is necessary for each person to have the ability to express their thoughts to contribute to the project or task. For the ideas to be narrowed down to the best, leadership and group evaluation is required. A group discussion of pros and cons is a good idea and friendly debates should be welcomed but to maximize productivity and optimize results, leadership is necessary to keep the group on the right track. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"This project is right up my alley in that it focuses on the AI aspect in biomedical technologies, which I find very interesting and something I want to do later on in industry. Most diseases diagnosed by doctors in present day require some sort of technology to confirm their prediction. This means that medical professionals heavily rely on these technologies and when something escapes the machine’s detection, doctors risk telling their patient false information. With the baby boomers aging, disease and sickness is a growing issue in our population. This project’s subject is really perfect for me as I have shadowed a general surgeon before and have experience in the process of diagnosis and treatment. This project will allow me to explore the more technical side of the medical field, the ‘behind the scenes’, which is nothing I have ever gotten to participate in before. I have a strong interest in the advancement of the medical field and improving the accuracy of treatment; the focus on improving AI detection is really want excites me and I would really love to be apart of this project. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I am interested in this project because there is a major issue when it comes to providing accurate and complete information when it comes to communication between practitioners and patients. This discrepancy can cause diagnosis or result in a decrease of a patient’s quality of care. I would like to join this project to bridge the gap between doctors and patients to save more lives and the project’s mission statement is something I am very passionate about. From my experiences of shadowing a general surgeon, I have learned that any delay in diagnosis can be deadly for the patient. Miscommunication or missing information risks the patient’s well being and a solution is needed to eliminate this error found in the process of diagnosis. Cancer is one of the number one killers that still plagues the human race today and early diagnosis is crucial to saving a patient’s life; the impact of this project would be huge and I want to contribute to the development of a tool that helps provide accurate communication for medical diagnosis, while learning data science.

In Professor Sridharan’s class, statistics and computer science intersect to allow me to gain knowledge and insight from real world datasets. Whether k-Nearest Neighbors, or simple A/B testing I can use skills in the classroom to learn more about the complexity and messiness of the real world.
        All I seek to gain from Discovery Research is an ability to take concepts and theory that I’ve learned in the classroom, and apply it to real world problems. To use the intersection of data and legal theory to understand the achievement divide in Berkeley Public Schools or combining medicine and computer science to better detect heart disease. I want an appreciation for the subjects I learn in class, not simply for the beauty of their theory, but also for their ability to push the human race forward.

        Working in a kitchen is exhilarating. Standing for 9-hour shifts is a test of endurance and speed. From lunch rush to dinner rush, every move is calculated, precise, and purposeful. And most importantly it is the SAT of teamwork. Failure to work together as a team, and the assembly line comes grinding to a halt. 
        I’ve worked 4 different jobs in restaurants, kitchens, or grocery stores, and each one has taught me valuable lessons about teamwork. It mandates mutual respect among co-workers, it thrives off of an ability to push others around you to work better, it succeeds through positive reinforcement and approachability, never negativity or closed-mindedness, and it necessitates that each member pull their own weight. When working as a team, my first priority is to do my due-diligence to make sure I am completing my fair share of work. In case I can not, it is my obligation to reach out to others for help, and in the case I can, it is my duty to help those around me. It is perfectly balanced. As all things should be.
",NASA data viz,"        It is no secret that the United States, and major airlines across the globe are facing a massive shortage of pilots. By Boeing’s estimate, it will have to hire 804,000 pilots over the next 20 years, a rate it simply currently can not support. The shortage of pilots is already having consequences. In April 2018, Emirates Airlines flew 36 777’s and 10 A380’s to Dubai Central Airport, and left them sitting their for months because there simply weren’t enough pilots to fly them. Thus a critical challenge in the coming decade will be training hundreds to thousands of new airline pilots as quickly as possible, all the while ensuring each one of them has the necessary skills and knowledge to safely perform their duties.
        It is for this reason NASA’s Data Visualization project is so interesting to me. The ability to use skills that I have mastered in classes like python programming, introductory machine learning, or linear algebra to create software to better train pilots and see their reactions to simulated events is profound. Through my various personal projects, whether creating a Scheme Interpreter in Python, or learning socket programming to build a collaborative queue music player application, I’ve demonstrated high levels of proficiency in Python. I’m deeply interested in the subject at hand, and believe I have the necessary skills and ability to learn quickly on the job to succeed in this position. I hope I can play a role in helping improve the next generation of flight training technology, and keep the skies as safe as possible.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"        Algorithms to increase the accuracy of concluding graph similarity will have wide reaching consequences for research in almost every field imaginable. It makes sense, graph representations arise naturally in a variety of presentations, and the ability to mine and extract complicated information from literal tons of graphs will serve as an important tool in the coming years. Algorithms to determine graph similarity have already seen wide-reaching applications, whether simply improving internet search results, deriving entire phylogenetic trees from similarity in metabolic pathways, radically altering social networking, and finding similar chemical structures in large databases. With the advent of machine learning, this field is soon to explode in innovation.
        It is for this reason that Lawrence Berkeley Lab’s research interests me. Through my various personal projects, whether creating a Scheme Interpreter in Python, or learning socket programming to build a collaborative queue music player application, I’ve demonstrated high levels of proficiency in Python. I am a quick learner and very adaptable. For any gaps in my knowledge that may concern you, I’d like to leave you with a simple fact about myself. I am an incredibly hard worker. Throughout high school, I worked 5 different minimum wage jobs trying to save up for college, and helping my mom pay the bills. I know the value of a good day’s work, and putting ever fiber of determination of your body to achieve the goal. Whether putting dinner on the table, or literally changing medicine and pharmaceuticals forever. I will give everything I have to this project, learn quickly, and hopefully help as much as I can. I just hope I can get the chance.",Forecasting Day Ahead Electric Load using a Machine Learning Application and Bottom-up Aggregation of Individual Meters,"        There is no need to exaggerate the world’s energy crisis in any way shape or form. If we as a species don’t find a way to reduce our need for fossil fuels, and more efficiently and cleanly harvest new sources of energy, great calamity and struggle will be our only reality. Luckily, machine learning technology, that using the literal petabytes of data our ‘Internet of Things devices’ produce everyday, can be used to determine where energy is needed, and when best to conduct operations to minimize energy usage. Moreover, it is literally impossible to conduct a one-hundred percent switch to renewable energies, unless we have some semblance of a ‘smart grid’ that is able to shift power to areas of higher demand and can anticipate energy needs far before they happen.
        It is for this reason that the research by East Bay Community Energy is so riveting to me. Through my various personal projects, whether creating a Scheme Interpreter in Python, or learning socket programming to build a collaborative queue music player application, I’ve demonstrated high levels of proficiency in Python. I am a quick learner, adaptable, and above all I can put the team above self. I believe I have the necessary skills and attitude to do well in the job, but most importantly I intrinsically have a deep connection to the subject matter. I want to see a world in which smart technology can help us solve the energy crisis. It is fascinating to me how tech and policy intersect in such a manner, and I’d just love to lend a helping hand.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Never applied before.,No.,None,At the suggestion of my Data Science uGSI.,"Thank you Data Science Discovery Committee along with industry and research partners for taking the time to look over my application. Before I hit submit and leave you, I'd like to end with a couple of parting thoughts. I understand that I am a Freshman, and naturally I have a limited skillset. But what I think matters is the capacity a person has to change, grow, and evolve. All three of these characteristics come from nothing but pure hard work and determination. It is this characteristic that I believe I have that sets me apart from other candidates. I know the value of hard work. Throughout high school, I worked 5 different minimum wage jobs, to help my mom pay the bills and save a little money for college. I'd work 30-35 hours in the summer, pushing shopping carts, cooking food, or cleaning shelves, and all the while I learned how important hard work is. If given the chance, I know I will push myself as far as I physically, emotionally, and mentally can to learn, and improve upon the project I am working on.

After attending a pair of hackathons, I understood what skills were important and required to create various applications and devices today, and I sought to learn them. I took CS 61A this fall semester, and enjoyed learning and practicing the Python language. It is very powerful, and I understood that it could be used to manipulate and power numerous web, data, and automation platforms. This class was very useful for my journey, as it motivated me to learn more. This winter break, I am currently taking a JavaScript bootcamp to understand the main principles of the language. Learning to code is a major source of interest for me, but I also am interested in researching and performing data analysis. Being able to use web platforms and tools to collect data and predict future trends is very applicable to what I am interested in and studying. ","I wish to gain more exposure to research and an insight on how data science is applied in today's world. Taking classes and having a general knowledge is not enough, so I wish to experience learning through a research lens. Research is an arduous yet exciting process full of failing and understanding those failures, which is something I want to be apart of. Being apart of Discovery Research will greatly increase my confidence to tackle and complete future challenges. Additionally, I want to experience working and researching with a team. I understand that there will be challenges and benefits along the way, but I will be able to learn a lot from my peers and their work alone. The comprehensive process of doing research and working in a team will educate and prepare me for my career ahead. ","I feel that teamwork is the reason why humans have been a successful civilization for such a long period of time. Governments are able to run because of teamwork. Companies run and deliver successful products because of teamwork. Universities provide an education to so many students because of teamwork. If I were to do research on a subject, I would want to work in a diverse group of members each possessing a different set of skills. In order to complete a task, many different perspectives are required to examine problems through multiple lens and figure out multiple solutions. I feel that a single line of reasoning is very ineffective to reaching a solution, and having multiple lines will expedite the process. Additionally, participating in any research requires completing multiple tasks. Assigning tasks to each team member based on their speciality would be very effective in completing the project faster given a deadline. Teamwork is essential to the success of any project or task given at hand.",Dispatcher algorithm,"I am interested in studying and interpreting data which processes into a form of machine learning.

Personally, translating the mess inside my head into language to share with the world is tedious, and everyday, I strive to clearly convey myself through the way I speak, the words I choose, and the intention behind my voice. However, nowadays, there are many times when we do not have the luxury to hear the voice or see the person when communicating. Language is so powerful, and yet so easily misunderstood simply by reading words in a text or on a page. In conversation, we are somehow able to see beyond the words and beyond the sounds we hear, and attribute a deeper meaning, intention, emotion, and more simply through innate intuition. But what about through other media? I want to learn how to define, quantify, and apply this “intuition” we have through the means of technology and data science. I want to see a machine be able to truly understand the complexities behind language that goes beyond the syntax, where one day we can express fully and truly our lives.","Through Discovery Research Program, I really hope to make connections with friends, faculty, and more who are passionate in the areas they study and the work they do, and explore and feed off of that passion together to create an impact in the communities. Not only do I want to connect with people and discover what drives them to love their research, but also learn from these sorts of driven people, which I believe to be the best way to learn and experience life. I hope to learn more about the application of data science outside of the classrooms, and how the information that I study from the lecture hall translate into the real world.","I believe communication is one of the most crucial aspects of teamwork. Consistent and effective communication to ensure that everyone has the same information to work with is extremely important for each person to be able to contribute to the goal most efficiently. Furthermore, being respectful in communication, not being scared to express one’s doubts, misunderstandings, or confusions, and being supportive and understanding of other people’s opinions and options will all enhance not only the team environment and morale, but also the quality of work the team outputs. I believe the team environment should be open, supportive, and trusting to ensure positivity, productivity, and efficiency.

I really wish to see how my experience and love for both linguistics, data science, and machine learning can be combined and applied in a true real world setting, and I genuinely want to connect with people who have similar passions as I do and create and learn with these types of people. I took Ling 110 this past semester, a class in phonetics, and had so much fun learning how to acoustically analyze recordings and sounds through waveforms and spectrograms. Throughout the course, it was clear that we were simply just scratching the surface in acoustic analysis, and my mind kept running with questions about not only acoustics, but the application of this technology through machine language. I am extremely interested in understanding the subtleties that are more difficult to detect simply by looking at the waveforms of acoustics, and discover the patterns within these acoustics that can be read and analyzed through machine learning. I really hope to be able to discover and learn more than I can even describe here about both linguistics and data science through this project.",Data Visualization for User Experience,"This project interests me because of my love of linguistics, data science and machine learning, and my desire to create inspiring and productive connections with people.

","Teamwork for me means to work in collaboration with one another for a common goal. 
This means that as a team we all work together, motivate each other, and help each other out. In order for their to be a positive and healthy working environment, especially in teams, there must be effective communication. No one should feel like they are doing all of the work, feeling left out, or unappreciated. As a team we must all communicate with each other effectively and help each other out. There is no race or competition on who is better, because at the end of the day we all have the same goal and as a team we will achieve it.

Slowly they rent out more and more classrooms and eventually take over half of the school. I know most Charter school's have better grade point averages than public schools in my community and provide a wider range of educational courses for students, and smaller classrooms but I am told to dislike them because they are taking over our Public Schools.

He would talk about organizing and marching for the removal of the factory due to it's negative affects to many of our community members. At that time I didn't really know what he was talking about, but now I do. I would love to be able to be a part of this team and be able to provide the public with a powerful application that allows them to know the status of their environment.

My name is Anna. I am in my third year studying Data Science and Computer Science.  Last summer, I interned at Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a Software Engineering intern, though I mainly worked on analyzing the types and frequencies of bugs on a project my team was working on. This coming summer, I will be interning at Facebook as a Software Engineer. Though I’ve taken multiple data science classes (Data 8, Data 100, and Data 144), I don’t have much hands-on experience with regards to my major — at least not outside the classroom. I am proficient in Java and Python, as well as many of Python’s libraries.

Besides academics, I am passionate about bridging the education gap in CS and increasing accessibility and diversity to the tech space. Last semester, I served as Internal Vice President of ANova, an on-campus organization which seeks to provide computer science education and mentorship to students in under-resourced schools and marginalized communities. ","Through Discovery Research, I am hoping to gain a hands-on experience in developing a strong data research project from start to finish. Having switched to the Data Science major recently and not knowing many peers in the major, I have had a difficult time at Berkeley looking for places that I can apply the tools and technology I have learned in the major-related classes I have taken. Though Data 100 had some very fun and interesting projects, it was very much a hand-holding experience, as each step of the project was led with specific instructions and there was typically a certain way to solve the problem the instructor was looking for. This program enables its students to venture into different areas of interest and apply their data science knowledge in other fields – this interdisciplinary aspect is exciting to me. I hope to be able to continue exploring my interests and learn about data science in a real-world application. ","Strong communication is essential to have an effective and efficient team. Without communication as a means to connect with one another, it is impossible to work together. Communication comes in multiple forms, such as getting to know my teammates to build trust, having respect for each other, and resolving conflicts by being an active listener and contributor to the conversation. The first step is understanding each teammate’s skillset — what they’re good at. If we get to know our teammates, it’ll be easier to partition the task at hand into different parts each person can handle. As a result, we build a level of trust and confidence amongst each other. Sharing opinions freely and learning to listen are also important and go hand-in-hand with each other and are necessary to be able to find the best solutions and also resolve the most difficult problems.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"Often times, we focus on the negatives around us, whether it be crime, injustice, or political conflicts. After all, these are the news that attract attention and controversial commentary. Yet, because of this, we lose sight of the good and right in the world. 

I enjoy the topic of this project because it is refreshing and focuses on the positives and is centered around creating an algorithm for detecting inclusive speech. I have some experience in text analysis, such as analyzing Trump's tweets and the positivity and negativity of Yelp reviews. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"I find the cannabis industry to be an extremely exciting topic as a whole, especially since currently more and more states and starting to legalize the usage of the product. As a result, states who have legalized it have experienced massive amounts of money from taxing marijuana products which in return is used to supplement state budget and fund state affairs. Due to the massive effects of legalizing cannabis, I am interested in seeing how the industry affects the United States as a whole, as well as applicable, individual states. I am also interested in seeing how cannabis is marketed differently is in different areas. 

I am experienced in data cleaning and am excited to find patterns of behavior in the dataset. I am eager to learn more about natural language processing to be able to effectively find trends in the product description data, and ultimately reveal elements that affect the market competition in the United States cannabis industry.

My name is Tushar Jain. I perceive and analyze data regularly to satiate my curiosity in strategy and decision analytics. Thinking logically, visually, and modularly has helped me grow professionally and personally. 

I'm a detail-oriented and forward-thinking third-year student! My passion lies in integrating creative storytelling with data analytics to help build businesses from the bottom up or to expand their current circle of influence - no matter the industry.

My naturally curious and problem-solving persona has driven me to work on my startup, write a blog, create promotional graphics and marketing assets as a creative designer, and most recently, develop my skillset for strategy marketing through multiple internships and campus ambassador opportunities. 

My short-term goal is to brainstorm about profitable ventures in the logistics and operations industry. On a fun note, I come from India and have a high tolerance for spice along with patience to watch cricket matches lasting 5 days.
","I wish to pursue the Data Science Discovery Program for 3 particular reasons. 

Reason 1, Modularity. The program will prepare me to mold myself to function on multidisciplinary teams and communicate effectively. Through the research project, I aim to broaden my horizons to have a better understanding of the analytical modeling of decision problems concerned with economic efficiency, productivity, and quality.

Reason 2, Impact. The program will allow me to interact with post-doctoral students and other qualified undergraduates to contribute to society academically. I want to unravel insightful analysis on the project I work with the help of my current skill-set. 

Reason 3, Discovery. The program will help me in my journey to draw a clear path for my career aspirations. It will allow me to explore different roles in a research environment and also provide me the resources in forms of mentorship and training to further my skills as an aspiring data scientist. 
","As a professional player at The Cricket Club of Berkeley, I learned that diversity is an act of survival and is displayed all across in our natural surroundings. 11 team members step onto the field, each one ready to play their part knowing the rest 10 will do the same. Making a mistake while playing gathers nothing but motivational words to do better the next time. The constant banter between teammates on topics gathered from prior social events makes the 4-hour game fun and light-hearted while maintaining the competitive spirit all along. Postgame lunches to review the highlights of the game and work on the weak components improve efficiency and facilitates improvement. This weekly endeavor has taught me that accountability, active listening, interaction outside the professional environment and sustainability are of prime importance in team setting. I have implemented the same approach in several projects and classes at Berkeley and have succeeded every single time. ",Data Visualization for User Experience,"The definition of design has had several eye-opening iterations for me throughout the years. 
It started off with an appeal to color and aesthetics and an implementation of childhood creativity towards graphic designing. Soon enough, acknowledging creativity in everyday products and recognizing natural recurring patterns became exciting. Design appeals to me as it has taught me a bottom-up approach towards problem-solving. Instead of directly striving to find a solution, design thinking has molded me to first modularly break down the problem into much simpler and solvable challenges. Design thinking has helped me understand the nuances between people and products, and why certain products are designed the way they are. 

Last semester, I had the chance to apply NLP techniques on large corpora of data along with sentiment analysis and data visualization in the Data Mining and Analytics Class.  
",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"Last semester, I took the course Pricing Strategies and Frameworks under Professor Wasim Azhar from the Haas School of Business. In this class, I learned the importance of market structures and their implications on Price. This class has helped me to read and analyze the trends in the market from price points of the product.

On one side of me is the concrete jungle known as Los Angeles, which I’ve traveled through my entire life. Some people despise the unpredictability and unreliability of Los Angeles, but I love it: through bumper-to-bumper traffic and sudden detours, Los Angeles has instilled in me a love for finding unexpected solutions wherever I go.

On the other side of me is the Angeles National Forest, which borders the quiet town in which I’ve grown up. To me, being in the outdoors is about more than just hiking through Devil’s Canyon and climbing the San Gabriel Mountains; it’s about community and being there for those around you, whether by helping a younger Scout learn to recognize poisonous plants or extracting ticks from a Scoutmaster's arm.

Strangely enough, these two opposing halves of my world have inspired my dreams of working in engineering, since engineering requires the two things most important to me: resourcefulness and collaboration. At the same time, it allows me to flourish in an almost-magical environment of infinite possibilities where I can work with others to find elegant solutions.","By participating in Discovery Research, I’d be able to apply my technical skills to other passions of mine, such as education and law. Although I’ve worked on many engineering projects in my CS classes, I’ve never received the opportunity to apply my technical skills to the social sciences, and would love to do so. 

I’m deeply passionate about projects that deal with large amounts of data, and I’d love to apply my previous experience working with data at my previous internships with Google and NASA. My technical skill set is extremely adaptable and I’m quick to pick up any skills which are needed for the situation. 

One of my favorite side projects to build was an educational app used by over 50,000 students and educators worldwide called BioPrep. Recently, I was also part of a team that was awarded $3,000 from the mayor of Los Angeles for developing a platform to connect homeless shelters with resources in the Los Angeles area.","Teamwork to me is all about being open and collaborative. It’s also about being empathetic and putting yourself in the shoes of others by listening to their perspectives. But most importantly, I believe it’s about bringing out the best in those around you. Being a great teammate means lifting up those around you and helping them do their best work.

As a volunteer for Berkeley Engineers and Mentors, I spend an hour each week helping elementary school students learn various STEM concepts, from Newton’s 2nd law to electrochemistry. I don’t think of myself as a teacher, but rather as a teammate helping my students collectively learn about science. One of the most important parts of helping them learn is understanding where their gaps are, and that requires careful listening and asking thoughtful questions.

I’ve tried to apply this approach to all situations where I’m working on a team, whether I’m working on a formal research project or working with elementary school students.",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"First, I’m fascinated by legal studies, particularly constitutional law. Last year I took Legal Studies 39D, a course examining current major conflicts in the country and relevant Supreme Court cases from history and the present day. I would love to combine my technical skills with my passion for law and the Supreme Court through this project.

Second, I’m intrigued by the technical aspect of the project. I’m really interested in Natural Language Processing, and have some prior experience working with text corpus processing via machine learning. If given the chance, I’d love to apply my data processing skills on perhaps one of the most important bodies of legal work in history.

Third, I’m very curious about the results of this project, and the questions it asks. Although there are some commonly accepted reasons as to why the Court may accept a case, it would be fascinating to see whether these reasons can be measured by analyzing the data, and how we can quantify these findings.",Computational Analysis of Charter School Identities and Stratification,"First, I’m passionate about education and how the landscape of education has transformed over the past several decades. Through an on-campus organization, I work with elementary students every week to teach them STEM concepts that they might not otherwise be exposed to in their normal curriculum. We particularly aim to target students from disadvantaged backgrounds, playing a small role in helping to bridge the education gap, ensuring that students from all walks of life are exposed to STEM fields at a young age.

Second, I’m intrigued by the technical aspect of this project, since it focuses on several of my interest areas. I’m a through-and-through Python aficionado, and would love to help design approaches to capture the data we’re looking for. I’ve worked with scraping extensively through personal and class projects, and I’m fascinated by how much data can be gleaned from the past.

Third, I’m really interested to see the results of this project, and how we can measure the findings. Although there are many ways to tackle the question of charter schools catering to certain race and class backgrounds, a purely data-driven approach is fascinating and I would love to be a part of it.",,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,A friend,Thank you for reading my application.,1,

Instead, my passion grew, especially the manipulations and combinations of numbers, and the art of cryptography. It happened when I read the Da Vinci Code where I decoded “Oh Lame Saint” to “The Mona Lisa” by using Fibonacci sequence. Here I realized math is not only about numbers, but also a language that can transfigure words in an artistic way. 
Since that day, I was enchanted by the art of cryptography. I aimed to master all of its concepts to capture the whole field. I read over 37 books such as *** and I even tried hunting institutions to enhance my knowledge. In fall 2016, I was fortunate to join a cryptography class at Berkeley’s math and CS department. Being a cryptography class freshman, I unfamiliar words such as the Columnar Transposition and Vigenere cipher welcomed me- throwing me in confusion. However, it didn’t discourage me- it even sparked my determination to explore the field deeper
Gripping wide knowledge about cryptography gave me a huge leverage. When I had my internship at AA Networks, a company that offers immediate and protected solution for voice and image delivery, last summer, this 2017, I’ve managed to secure my position when they entrusted several tasks to me like working with the cyber security group, where we had to filter contents and strengthen the system’s security. But things started to shatter when a bug was found in the encryption system, breaking the company’s stableness. With the help of # co-workers and extended # hours of working, we found our way out. Using the mathematical algorithms, we configured the bug and resolved the whole issue. 
",A new thinking way about the data and the future technology.,"The lesson that I learned in a group project in my Physics class had taught me what the teamwork really is. We were assigned to groups of four by our teacher, and tasked with choosing a leader amongst ourselves. This task did not start us off on the right foot – rather, it inspired quite a struggle. The position meant a risk of an extra penalty should we do poorly, without the incentive of a bonus should we lead well. We bickered and stalled, and before long, I knew what I had to do. Hesitantly, I stepped up and took the lead.
A great leader must lead by example, and so, I dove into the work head first. I plotted out the assignment, organizing the project by task and teammate. I realized that the best way to lead was to serve, so I worked hard to present a clear path to success. Once the tasks were delegated, I lead the charge by completing my own portion right away. 
My confidence and hard work inspired my entire team, and they each committed themselves wholeheartedly to their tasks. When it came time for the final presentation, I gave my team the best parts of the project to present, rather than taking them for myself.
I had realized by then that a leader’s job is to help their teammates to shine. For a task I had initially dreaded, I was shocked to find myself pleased in my work. I learned that when a leader decides to be the last to enjoy the fruits of labor, they find instead the satisfaction of helping others succeed and of having had the courage to do the jobs that no one wanted.

	Throughout most of my life, I have been a quiet person. During high school, I was afraid to step out of my comfort zone. Nothing interested me, and motivation was something I struggled to find. But as I entered college and looked back at my past 18 years, I realized that I didn’t want to continue on this path. As a result, I dedicated college to self-improvement.
	I have many goals that I hope to achieve throughout my time here at Berkeley. I want to overcome my fears of public speaking and talking to others by meeting as many new people as possible. I hope to find something that I am passionate about at Cal. I want to learn more about the issues around me and see if I can play a part in confronting and solving these issues. And most importantly, I want to step outside of my comfort zone and grow as a person. 
	As a result, I’ve been up to many things. Although I could have elaborated more on my academic interests and experiences, I felt that this part of my life represented me the best. 

","	It wasn’t until the final project of Data 8 when I realized that I was interested in data science. Seeing how all of my accumulated knowledge about statistics and coding could be used to find conclusions in data was something that I wanted to do for a living. However, there are only a handful of data science classes on campus. And although I wanted to start on my own data science projects, I struggled knowing where to start and lacked guidance. 
	As a result, what I wish to gain through the Discovery Research is guidance for how to conduct a data science project from start to finish. I am confident that I can learn all the skills necessary to make any data science project a success, but applying those skills in the correct manner is something that can only be learned through experience. With the help of the Discovery Program, I will get a better understanding of how to apply my knowledge of statistics and coding. I wish to learn how to apply my knowledge to complete data science projects that can help make a positive impact in the community. 
","	Through my experiences being a team member and a leader, I have grown to realize that the most important thing for excellent teamwork is communication. Since everyone on the team is collectively working towards the same goal, communication is crucial to make sure that everyone is on the same page. 
	As a result, one of the first things I do with a new team is taking the time to make sure I get to know everyone on my team. Whether that be through getting to know them as I worked or hanging out with them outside a work setting, by breaking down the walls of unfamiliarity and no longer being strangers to one another, the team members become more comfortable communicating with each other.
	Afterwards, when the team begins to work, I make sure to get everyone’s input and check up with everyone as much as possible. Additionally, I will make sure to over communicate at times. All of this is to make sure that everyone on the team feels included and is on the same page. The success of the team relies on everyone; communication is the key to unlocking that success.
",Environmental Health Estimator,"          During my summer internship at Breathe California, I became acquainted with issues surrounding the environment as I assisted with the Senior Health Program. Through research and speaking to those affected, I learned about how the environment’s health could have huge impacts on communities. But even though this was a big issue, through my work at my internship I realized that it was incredibly difficult to raise awareness.
          Then, during my time at DataStory Consulting, I continued learning about environmental health by getting involved with data surrounding environmental justice. As I learned more and more about how bad the environment was and about its many consequences and impacts, I knew I wanted to contribute to the solution to this problem. But how?
          DataStory Consulting showed me that I could help; I could use my data science and coding skills to help in a myriad of ways. I am interested in the Environmental Health Indicator Project because not only will I be able to apply my knowledge of data science and environmental health to help combat this issue, but I will also be able to meet others who are also dedicated to raising awareness about environmental health.

",Cal Alumni Association Analysis of Engaged Alumni,"         As a teenager, I was told that private schools were significantly better than public schools because of the alumni network and because alumni were more dedicated to giving back. But is this really the case? 
         I am interested in this project not only because I want to learn more about the alumni and life after college, but also because I want to find out if some people are more likely to be better alumni than others. I want to see if there is a correlation or a variable between alumni who are more likely to give back to the school versus those who are less likely. Are there ways to make students become better alumni, or maybe their majors play a big role in their engagement after college? Trying to figure out these correlations and variables would not only be a valuable experience for me, but they could also be valuable information for the school. As a result, I would love to learn more about Cal Alumni through the Cal Alumni Association Analysis of Engaged Alumni project.

The joke in the family is, immediately after birth I asked the nurse why she’s wearing pink. Taking quiz-bowl as a sport, has helped me flourish, giving me a peek into fascinating subjects like Mathematics and Chemistry, and making me aware of world’s minutiae like a Coyote can hear a mouse under a foot of snow and Donald Duck comics were banned in Finland because he does not wear pants. My sport(quiz-bowl), leads me to do many things, some more readily than the others: I am impelled to peruse the dailies (yes, I still read them in print) which is enjoyable, but organizing and participating in State level quizzes while maintaining academic rigor is challenging. In the quest for greater knowledge, I have dived to subterranean levels, scouring tomes on the Biological Sciences, and Encyclopedia Britannica volumes. Each day, I unfailingly post the “QUESTION OF THE DAY” in the India Quiz Forum group that I administrate. Asking the right question and getting the precise answer is delight of my day.
Quizzing has imbibed in me the spirit of learning from every situation and every subject. It whets my sense of humor and polishes my regular Standup comedy routine, ‘Improv’ at a local club which includes intriguing factoids (McDonalds calls their frequent customers “heavy” users and you burn more calories sleeping than watching TV). I’ve learned putdowns incomprehensible to most eg–Colgate in Spanish translates to “go hang yourself”.

But Ankit who I knew just casually had considerable Income-Tax knowledge. I decided to take a data-driven approach to preclude friendship considerations. Using statistical analysis, I evaluated the candidates on weighted average scores, loading parameters like past performance, domain knowledge, quiz format and thereafter plotting graphs and ogives, the universal “line of best fit” method. My school Principal saw the unfailing mathematical logic and instituted this as the benchmark system for all future team selections. Leading the team (with Ankit), we won the championship.

I can enjoy many genres of music, but it's classical music that I enjoy the most and am the most knowledgeable about. This connects with the fact that I also like being cultured, or having knowledge of cultures around the world, so I enjoy learning languages and traveling, though my interests tend to be a bit Eurocentric. So far, I am conversational in French, and would love the opportunity to have conversations in French, teach what I can of it, help with anything French or France related, etc., even if it's just having casual conversations in French with other project team members in this program. ","Since I am very limited in my overall experiences with Data Science outside of academic classes, I really hope that this can be an opportunity for me to gain more hands-on experience using the skills I've acquired in classes. I want to apply my Data Science knowledge to real world cutting-edge data research projects, and explore much more on how data analysis can be used to gain insights on some pressing problems in this world. ","My approach to teamwork is best described with examples. When I was in middle and high school, I played cello in orchestras both in and outside of school. In high school, I was first chair cellist in my advanced youth orchestra and had to be both a team player and leader. As a leader, I offered suggestions to other cellists on bowings, fingerings, and other technical aspects of playing. However, I also communicated constantly with the conductor and other section leaders and did my best to learn the parts of other sections so I could offer well-informed suggestions to the cellists regarding aspects like articulation, style, dynamics, etc. In a team setting, I usually tend to be a player, but I do enjoy taking the lead in situations where I feel confident enough to do so. ",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"I really love learning languages, as well as exploring differences between intra and inter-familial languages. The opportunity to do cross-linguistic analysis really excites me. While I am interested in further developing my machine learning skills, it's the linguistic aspect that excites me even more. Learning languages is a hobby that I wish I had more time for, and doing something linguistics related and improving my knowledge and skills in that field is one of my goals/dreams, and this sounds like the perfect opportunity to turn all of this into an accomplishment.  ",Dispatcher algorithm,"The Kiwibots on our campus are among the many things that give me pride for this school since despite our society's increasing deployment and reliance on Artificial Intelligence, the bots are still a relative novelty and not yet mainstream. Thus, they are nothing less than objects of fascination to visitors on our campus. However, to me, they are also nothing more than that based on what I hear from students who actually utilize the service. Therefore, I am interested in opportunities to improve the service, such as this project, involving optimizing the Kiwi Mate and robot assignation for orders received. ",Student Success Analytics Platform,"As a student myself, I have experienced the frustration of not knowing whether I'm on the right track to succeed at my goals or not. If we are talking about academic success, in computer science courses especially, as both a student and instructor, I fully understand the unpleasantness of the uncertainty that comes with not knowing what you need on an exam to get a certain grade due to the curve, thus not knowing how much of our limited time to allocate to studying for the class. There are many other hindrances to student success, some of which can be systematic and beyond the student's control. While this project is a good fit technical skills wise, and I want to further employ and develop my machine learning skills, the issue at hand hits close to home for me, and I want to contribute to the effort of giving every student a chance to succeed.

From a very young age, I have tried to work hard in hopes of one day making my family and myself proud. Before UC Berkeley I was unsure about what I wanted to do with my life, but I enjoyed math. I most enjoy the analytical thinking and problem solving math requires. But, I wanted to manipulate numbers and apply my mathematical skills in a different way. After taking Data 8 and other data science courses, I feel a new profound dedication and passion about my goal of professionally pursuing data science. ","From this program, I wish to find a community of other students interested in Data Science. I have found it difficult to find a smaller community at Cal because I have taken large classes and encounter students of different, various interests. Furthermore, I hope to develop my analytical skills and become more involved in data science opportunities outside the classroom. I hope to learn about and practice more data manipulations, analysis, and visualization techniques.","I find it crucial to respect everyone's opinions and knowledge. I understand that everyone and I have their strengths and their weaknesses. I find it very important to learn from my team and to offer my teammates the help they may ask for.

And, online platforms have a huge impact on mental health. During one of the courses I have taken, one data scientist came to speak to our class. He worked at a company that researches suicide and how to help with the cause. I was truly inspired by his talk.

This was slightly difficult because I had the entire student body, in addition to my entire family, trying to force more “traditional” and right wing values upon me, but with the help of the internet and a growing interest in social justice issues, I persevered. While my interest in social activism grew, so did my interest in studying the brain, as I had just taken a psychology class and had also finally come to terms with the fact that everyone in school knew I had a neurological disability called cerebral palsy after my legs were put into casts to stretch them. In fact, coming into Cal I wanted to study cognitive science because I found the study of the brain so interesting. Unfortunately in my sophomore year I left Cog Sci behind to major in Data Science (with an emphasis in cognition!) after reading an article my grandpa had emailed to me about how “up and coming” data science is, and I’ve been here ever since. ","I wish to gain experience by applying my pre-existing data science skills to projects that I am passionate about, as well as learning more relevant skills to help further both the research project and my growth as a data scientist and a person. I also wish to gain more knowledge about the project I am working on. Many of these projects deal with issues such as social justice and environmental justice or seek to better humanity and life in one way or another through data science and technology, and this is one of the reasons I was drawn to data science in the first place. I also want to be able to see the results of my work on a project and I believe the Discovery Research is a great program to do that. I want to learn!","I consider myself a mediator when it comes to teamwork. To me, this means that I make sure that all voices and opinions are heard, which helps ensure that there are few conflicts within the team. I also mediate in times of conflict and make sure that my team reaches a resolution. I believe making sure everyones voices are heard when it comes to ideas, as well as how best to move forward in a project, is the best way to come up with the best solution, and allows the team to run smoothly. I enjoy working with a team because it allows me to bounce my ideas off others as well as ask for help when needed. To me, a team needs to be effective, open-minded, and efficient.",Addressing Structural Inequality in U.S. Agricultural Higher Education:  An Assessment of Pedagogical Practices and Food Systems Coursework at Land-grant Institutions,"I was instantly hooked on this project after I read it’s description. The topic of structural inequality within Universities and how it affects students is something that I was aware of, but coming from a place of privilege, have never quite experienced. However, I witnessed similar structural inequalities within my predominantly white, straight, and cis catholic high school, which is what sparked my interest in social justice. I am interested to learn more about how these universities utilize their curriculum to marginalize (intentionally or unintentionally) certain communities within their program due to their teaching of food systems topics. I also appreciate that this project is a “learn-by-doing” project. As someone who doesn’t have an extensive amount of experience, I think this type of research project is one that would benefit me greatly and give me that experience that I need in order to move forward as a data scientist. I am excited to not just apply my pre-existing data science and coding skills, but also learn new ones in a team environment where I can learn from my peers. ",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"This past semester (Fall 2019) I took a course that I loved called International Environmental Politics (ESPM 169) where I learned a lot about environmental justice, as well as the environmental issues being dealt with both here in the US but also in other countries and the world as well. I also learned a lot about policymaking when it comes to environmental issues, and when I read this project description, I was instantly drawn in due to its similarities to the topics covered in this course. I feel like this project will give me a great opportunity to apply my pre-existing data science knowledge in database management and data analysis, as well as my ability to code in python, and allow me to learn more technical skills to better assist the project and I’m very excited to learn more about environmental justice and issues facing each state.",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"I’m interested in this project because I’m a woman in tech and am very interested in the data and research being done. Having female representation in tech is something that I'm very passionate about. In high school, I was one of three girls on our robotics team and my primary role was that of outreach, which involved going to elementary schools and getting kids excited about tech. While in this role, I tried to put an emphasis on getting the girls at these schools excited about tech because I felt that the key to getting more girls interested in the tech industry is to inspire them and show them that they can still participate in tech when they're older. While I am very fortunate to be living in a time where women can make an impact in and take space in a previously predominantly male field, this was not always the case just two generations ago and I'm interested to see how this has changed in just two generations of women. As women, we have made such important progress but the lack of women in technical majors such as eecs illustrates that there is still much to be done. I personally am very interested to see just how much women in STEM majors and the tech field have increased over time, and I feel like this is a project that I am truly passionate about. This project would also allow me to use and hone my data visualization skills.

My name is Alan and I was born and raised in the Bay Area. In my free time, I always love learning new things and during this break, I even started learning some guitar! Besides learning things, I also enjoy teaching! All throughout high school, I enjoyed teaching elementary students a wide variety of subjects ranging from STEM concepts to helping improve reading literacy. Coming into Berkeley, I thought I would follow the premedical pathway because I enjoyed helping and interacting with people. However, I began questioning my choice and that made my 2nd semester mentally straining. Begining of Sophmore Year, I decided to explore other possibilities and fell upon CS61A. Even though it was difficult with the little experience I had, I liked the problem solving involved and wanted to dig more into its applications. Specifically, I’m very interested in Machine Learning/AI systems in healthcare because though I may not be premed anymore, I’ve come to learn that I can still make an impact in healthcare.

When switching majors I found that I was lost due to a lack of guidance and I had difficulty finding some so I’m hoping that through this program I would be able to interact with people in the data science space and learn a lot of new things that I may find new passions for! ","My approach to teamwork would be to emphasize the importance of communication, respect, as well as organization. Communication is essential to monitor progress as well as understanding difficulties that individuals may encounter. Communicating the difficulties is what allows a team to move forward as everyone else can possibly provide assistance as well as eliminate any confusion. Keeping everyone in the loop is what is important for a project to succeed. Besides that, respect is also key in teamwork. Respecting what everyone has to say and encouraging people to speak up is necessary since sharing ideas and brainstorming is essential for any type of project. If everyone in a team can respect one another, this will lead to fewer conflicts. Lastly, organization is also important in teamwork. Delegating tasks and organizing a plan or timeline will help establish a clearer sense of the project’s end goal. Organizing will allow for greater monitoring of progress and allow for a more effective team.",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I’m very interested in this project because I would like to work with predictive analytics in healthcare and this project is exactly what I was looking for since it involves using medical data and information to refine and improve cancer detection and treatment. I was fortunate to be able to work with a company that focused on the application of machine learning in their urine analysis machine to detect acute kidney injury and I was honestly amazed by how an algorithm could help so many people using only the urine of patients. I would like the opportunity to work and learn from this project this because I believe that the further development of projects like this will greatly impact the field of healthcare and save the lives of many. My grandparents died of cancer and it was due to late detection of the disease which made treating it difficult. By improving detection and refining cancer treatment through this project, cancer deaths will greatly decrease.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,I would like to work on this project because I’m very interested in AI in medicine and predictive healthcare. This project is a bit similar to a project that I was fortunate enough to work on which involved helping a biomedical company refine its algorithm that allowed for the detection of acute kidney injury by collecting data of various characteristics of urine and using them to piece together a clearer image of the patient’s kidney health. I am very interested in helping develop and creating something that will make an impact on healthcare and refining the detection of CVD will prevent millions of death since it is so prominent in society due to it being hereditary. ,Environmental Health Estimator,"I am interested in this project because I would like to work on a project that involved predictive analytics.

I'm going to be a second semester senior, and I just declared data science last semester. I started off college pre-med, switched to Economics and Public Health, and finally, as a spring junior year, decided to fully dive into data science. Since then, I've been lucky enough to experience a rather rigorous yet highly rewarding data science internship, and lead a project in NLP and Cloud for the Data Science Society. The one constant for me has been my mission to utilize my skills for good - as university students, we are already privileged. As UC Berkeley students, we are beyond privileged. Whether it's growing my skillset through pro-bono work, or consulting for nonprofits or social enterprises that don't have the funds to hire help otherwise, it's always a win win, and I can't imagine my college career without these engagements outside academics. College has been a really interesting experience for me, as after I grew up with very helicopter parents and had my path dictated to me, I suddenly became financially and completely independent - every decision, every class, every club, everything I cooked, how I spent my money, how I earned my money all became new items to navigate. I guess from being an extra broke broke college student, to learning more about myself and joining the DSP program in college, I definitely gained a lot more perspective and maturity, as well as clear reflective and decision making process in life. I'm scrappy, and have a pretty targeted approach to life in general, and the way I think about problems and find or build solutions for them.","In high school, I did research in URAP at the Purdue College of Pharmacy, working on reformulating anti-cancer drugs as nanocrystals to increase efficacy of drug delivery. I've always been interested in continuing research, but after the many major and academic changes in college, haven't had the chance to do so. I initially considered data science moreso as a tool in industry i.e. another job, but quickly discovered how powerful a resource data is in itself, and how just like strategy, it has many applications across many domains and types of entities. Research has been on my college bucket list, and I think I finally have the solid technical skills required, as well as the perfect opportunity to engage through the Discovery program during my last semester at UC Berkeley. I'm naturally a very curious person, and through research, I want the chance to explore, play with different tools, read papers and articles, implement said papers and articles, diversify the kinds of experiences I have, as well gain more experience collaborating on a data project.","It's all about active listening and communication from all parties involved. I love brainstorming and discussing ideas together, but I am also the ""puppy shooter"" if you will and more practical about narrowing in on feasible solutions. Setting a master plan and deadlines we all agree on is key before going off to work independently on delegated tasks. Even when working independently, I think it's super invaluable to maintain active communication, keeping everyone in the loop and checking in, and asking for advice and support. I also make sure I am as available as possible to help other team members if needed.

As a data scientist, I know a meta approach can yield larger picture trends and insights, yet it’s not an ideal world where we can employ the ideal experimental design. From an academic standpoint, I’m curious to tackle this practical limitation with statistical testing and techniques. The idea of combing through papers and aggregating and cleaning all the data, then analyzing it excites me as a data scientist.",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"AI in diagnostics is unbelievably powerful, and in some use cases, actually beats human interpretation.

I have lived in six countries and thus formed a diverse mindset as well as an adaptability to change. Last summer I had an internship at Estonian Energy where I used Python neural networks to model the renewable energy market and predict some future discount rate trends.

I am an avid space fanatic and spent last year working in a student engineering team, building a can-sized satellite for the international CanSat Competition in Texas which we also attended this summer, finishing in the top ten of 40 teams.  My role was as software engineer in the electronics sub-team. This meant programming (C#/C++) the software to run on the Teensy microcontroller on the satellite. Furthermore, as part of the electronics sub-team I aided with the design of the Python ground station program, selecting electrical parts and electrical assembly. This project took up 10+ hours a week and was one of the most rewarding parts of the second year of university and I hope to have more experiences like this.

I am now also an avionics engineer at Space Enterprise at Berkeley. It is extremely exciting to be a part of a successful rocketry society with a focus on palpable goals. We are currently building a liquid fuel rocket with an altitude goal of 45000 feet. I am specifically working on controlling valve opening and closing for successful propulsion, and will soon start work on creating a radio communications module. As such, I am again working in Arduino and with electronics, but the more hands-on feeling of aiding the propulsion team makes this experience stand out from my satellite building days. Our first engine test fire is set for the start of this semester.

In Manchester I was also the treasurer and co-founder of the Baltic Society, a cultural society started to introduce culture from the Baltics to people of other nationalities, and offer a place for Baltic students to feel at home. We did this through hosting various academic events such as lectures and debates, as well as social events like pub crawls and cuisine nights. I left the society with a heavy heart and cannot wait to get back on the board in fourth year, possibly applying for president.

Besides these extracurriculars, I was a frequent visitor of events hosted by the Astronomy Society, the Mathematics Society, and the Physics Society, getting a chance to network with many of my academic idols and influential professionals. I also enjoy the visual arts and besides practicing at home, attended art history lectures without credit, which was very interesting.","I would like to work in an inspiring team like the team I worked with this summer, and continue with the momentum I gained from those two months. I would hope to produce meaningful research and hopefully results, so as to leave a mark in California before going back to Manchester. Furthermore, I would like to get a deeper understanding of the Californian work/academic culture and figure out if this may be something worth coming back to in the US after graduation. I would also like to fill as much of my time as possible in a meaningful way and practice self-discipline, so as to build a healthy routine.
","I try to be as open and communicative as possible, and see myself as rather talkative in a specialised environment such as a workplace or an academic team. I try to place a significant amount of trust in others in the team, and expect a result without being too controlling, while hoping to provide the same. I also hope demonstrating a motivated approach by positive practices like being on time, and making plans and openly discussing their progress, will motivate others in the team. I approach conflict without getting aggravated or personal and see potential in everyone.",NASA data viz,"I have developed my passion for aerospace through several amateur projects, including the Manchester CanSat Project (MCP) and Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB). At MCP, our 10-student team competed in and achieved 10th place in the international CanSat Competition for building can-sized satellites. As the flight software engineer, I enjoyed programming the brain for a two-stage satellite that monitored aspects of its flight, and released an autonomous auto-rotating payload. At SEB, we are currently building a stepping stone of a spaceshot rocket, a liquid rocket with a 45000 feet target. As the avionics engineer, it is exciting to work on something so powerful and much more hands-on with propulsion than the satellite. Both of these projects have solidified my aspirations of working in the aerospace industry. However, as a European resident, it has been difficult to find chances to do this in the US. Thus this project is a great opportunity to get a headstart. 
Furthermore, I am familiar with Python, and spent last summer analyzing data, and due to quick progress, even developing a machine learning model, on renewable energy production. This internship was challenging, but interesting, and I would love to work once again on a project as engaging. Applying these skills in a different context would be a great learning experience. Moreover, what I liked about the previous project was my displaying and presenting the results in my analysis to the largest energy company in Estonia the positive effects of increasing renewable energy production. The project at hand, too, has a clear goal of helping future technology and people, and this palpable goal motivates me.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"I have specialised in topology in my mathematical carreer, having already taken five courses in topology and geometry. Reading the book ""Love and Math"" by Edward Frenkel was my first view into this field, and after its explanations of knot groups I was drawn into algebraic topology, and also ended up taking a course in differential topology, which surprised me pleasantly with its slightly different, but still familiar, methodology. So I already see topology as my chosen mathematical field in the future, and to be able to participate in this project by looking at some real-world applications of it in the form of manifold learning, and graph models, would be interesting and fitting.
Furthermore, in my internship last summer I developed a machine learning model in Python for forecasting renewable energy market discount, and found this extremely fun. I would love to try ML again in a new context and further develop this truly exciting power of computers. My familiarity with Python would hopefully mean this project is suitable, and I am looking forward to trying more packages besides the Keras, seaborn, pandas etc. that I have so far worked with.
Lastly, it is always inspiring to work on applications of mathematics in the real world - in my current pure mathematical classes, I have been missing the courses like fluid dynamics and mathematical modelling that I was able to enroll in back in my home university (as an exchange student from the University of Manchester), which is known for its applied mathematics. At Berkeley I am not able to take as many courses in applied mathematics. As such, I have to spring at this opportunity.",Data visualization and analytics for off-grid solar in Africa,"Sustainability is an important value for me and I would like to contribute to making the world more sustainable as much as possible. I am also a big believer in renewable energy, and hence did an internship in analysing and building a model for data of renewable energy production from the biggest energy company in Estonia. This involved standard analysis, and developing a machine learning model. The result was a model showing future discount rates of renewable energy - wind, solar and hydro. Solar power, however, was the one with least data, as my focus was on North-Eastern Europe. Thus, I did not get as much of an insight into the current situation, and realistic future predictions, of the production and market prices of solar energy. That is why this project is of great interest to me - it provides a great learning experience, and complements my previous skills and knowledge.
Moreover, I have done much data analysis and visualisation in my mathematical career, as well as for an internship and extracurriculars. I practice visual art as a hobby, and thus find this blend of science and art pleasant to work with. The opportunity to use FaceBook AI, which I have not worked with, and developing a project for a different continent, is very exciting.

Growing up, winter and summer breaks meant family road trips to state and national parks, and we’ve hiked through countless parks and landmarks. My time outdoors has ingrained a deep appreciation for the environment. Unfortunately, as a consequence of increasingly exacerbated climate change, the health and success of the planet is critically threatened. Not only are keystone species and the ecosystems they are a part of at risk, human societies are at risk as well, as the environments that sustain them begin to fail. 

Maybe because I spent so much time outdoors, I have a great interest in the intersection of science and technology. I'm especially interested in how technological innovation can potentially help ameliorate some of the environmental issues at hand. Perhaps, with the right amount of research and some luck, we might achieve a breakthrough or two that will make it easier for us to help the planet.
","Given the classes I’ve explored in Berkeley so far, I’ve covered a wide variety of topics ranging from data acquisition and analysis, to upper level algorithms and mathematics, to lower level computer architecture and electrical engineering. Although the content covered within this wide range is incredibly interesting and engaging, the context of projects with which we use to explore and apply these topics is notably broken down and constrained to make it easier for us to digest as first time students towards these different topics.

I genuinely understand and appreciate the way these projects are presented such that we’re not necessarily thrown off the deep end into struggling our way through these new, and sometimes intimidating, topics. However, given that I feel that I’ve had my taste of what these topics look and feel like, I would welcome an opportunity to refine and develop these skills that I’ve picked up in my classes by applying them to the context of real-world scenarios. I hope that through Discovery Research, it will provide a lense for me to help guide and focus my attention and skills in my pursuit of solutions to these impactful projects and problems.
","Although plans are essential in providing direction and structure to a project, I feel that it’s important to approach these plans as guidelines, not as a rulebook, in order to readily adapt and meet whatever circumstances may arise during the execution of the project. For a team to meet this quality of adaptability and thereby excel at a project, I believe it’s necessary for healthy lines of communication to be proactively developed and established. 

This communication is crucial such that all my teammates are either aware of the current direction a project is taking, or else updated of a possible change or shift in direction. If a project needs to change or shift in direction, its important to first communicate that need to my teammates, followed by a discussion of possible ideas as to how we could change or shift that direction to meet our current needs. Thus, we’re able to not only get different ideas from different perspectives on how to approach a problem, but also simultaneously cross-reference these ideas across our diverse range of perspectives captured among our team members. By taking advantage of our fresh, varied perspectives, the teams that I partake in are capable of coordinating efficiently and effectively, thereby maximizing our overall potential.
",BEACO2N,"The ability to accurately measure the types and concentrations of the contaminants polluting our air is a vital first step in order to address the current state of our air quality. Especially when considering the numerous associations between poor air quality and negative health consequences ranging from developmental disorders, to respiratory issues, to the degradation of mental health, it is evident that the identification of what is in the air we breathe is an important question towards protecting and improving our health and well-being.

I believe that the method of exploring and evaluating the quality of our air via raw voltages seems to be a powerful approach towards achieving this goal. By helping collect this data on the current state of our air and publicizing it in clear and effective visualizations and models, I hope to contribute to the foundation of educating the public and community in making informed decisions on how to best regulate and improve air quality. Furthermore, these visualizations and models would be integral in helping provide potential insight into different ways we might be able to further probe or address the quality of the air we breathe.
",D3 Data Viz using climate finance data,"Given the recent wave of environmental disasters, it is clear that the effects of climate change are now taking hold and being expressed in an alarming variety of ways, as both ecosystems and human communities are being placed at risk. Given the capitalism-centric global economy, climate finance is a vital angle by which to address and tackle climate change, with the potential to provide valuable insight into what methods might be more or less optimal in applying climate finance.

Therefore, I hope that by working with this dataset and contributing to the development of these interactive graphics, powerful insight might be attained as to what the most effective financial practices and policies might be in order to contribute to the mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, when executed correctly, visualizations and interactive graphics are powerful tools capable of communicating information clearly and concisely. I hope that by contributing to these projects, I can possibly help further encourage others to follow suit in optimal practices and finance management in the pursuit of climate change mitigation.
",Community Air Monitoring Monthly Report,"Access to clean air is becoming increasingly limited. As a result of rapid population growth, industrial manufacturing and the use of personal transportation has only increased, thereby leading to a subsequent rise in pollutant emissions.

This gradual decline in air quality is strongly associated with severe detrimental effects upon our health, ranging from developmental disorders, to respiratory issues, to the degradation of mental health. Given the multifaceted impacts poor air quality has upon our capacity to lead healthy, fulfilling lives, I hope that by contributing to the development of these metrics proposed within the project, I can help educate communities and the public about the kinds of contaminants that pollute the air we breathe, and the subsequent consequences those contaminants impose upon their health. I believe this understanding and education is vital to helping communities make informed decisions on how to best address and improve air quality.

For much of my life, I had been afraid to expand and try new things and seemingly unable to actively seek out new opportunities. As such, I began my college experience too afraid to even consider joining any organizations and continued to pursue a career in premed despite being unsure if that was what I truly wanted. After a miserable first year, I knew that I needed to change. I forced myself to leave my comfort zone by joining a dance organization despite never having danced before. Dancing in public had been something I had dreaded my entire life and I felt that if I could overcome this, doing more would be easy. Surprisingly, it worked. I became more confident in myself and slowly shed my shyness. I worked up the courage to stop pursuing medicine and focus instead on Data Science, which I felt was the right path for me. In addition, as I grew more confident and interacted with more and more people, I discovered a love for teaching and communication, something that would have terrified me in the past. Now, I am hoping to explore more about myself and learn even more.
. ","Primarly, I wish to gain hands on research experience that will help me as a Data Scientist in the future. I want to have a clearer picture as to what kind of work I will be doing as a Data Scientist and explore what career paths would be best suited to me.

Perhaps working on a specific project could actually reveal a new found love for a subject that I had previously not expanded on or otherwise dismissed","In my opinion, the most important aspect of teamwork is humility. For a team to succeed to its fullest, each member must always be willing to accept criticism and should never act condescendingly in any way. In doing say, nobody will feel afraid to contribute an idea and more perspectives are explored. Furthermore, there must be clear communication between such that everyone has an idea about what each person is doing and responsible for. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"As somebody who had originally been set on a career in medicine, I have always maintained a desire to help as many people as possible. In particular, quite a few members in my family have been affected by cancer and I want nothing more than to be able to help save lives from it. As I am no longer pursuing a path in medicine, I was extremely excited to learn that I would still have the opportunity to fight cancer as a Data Scientist. In addition, I want to learn more about how data science and medicine are inter-connected and consider possible career paths in the future. Despite my change in career choice, I still want to be involved in the medical sphere and I believe this project would help me explore two things that I am very interested in.",Kiwibot delivery robots,I have always been interested in exactly how the kiwi bots I see around everywhere work and I would love to have the opportunity to work closely with them.

I truly enjoy volunteering and giving back to the community and it always puts a smile on my face knowing that I’ve helped someone and had a positive impact in someone’s life whether big or small. I’m also really passionate about music and things related to it (hence the intended music minor). I like to play piano, sing, and dance. I’ve been doing all three of these for as long as I can remember and I can’t imagine my life without them. Music is my best destresser and I like to improvise and sight read new pieces on the piano, take a dance class, or sing to myself when I feel overwhelmed by my academics. ","I am interested in pursuing a career in Data Science and I view Discovery Research as a good way to gain experience in the field and to improve on and gain data science skills while also receiving mentorship and learning from those around me.

I will also be able to work closely and build connections with students that have similar interests to me.","I think teamwork is extremely important in ensuring that a project is done efficiently and with the best quality. I am typically the mediator in a team because I am very open-minded and I always try to ensure that everyone feels supported and welcome. Being open-minded encourages team members to voice their own opinions and ideas, bringing to the table a variety of new ways to think about and do things. Open-mindedness can also prevent and resolve misunderstandings and other obstacles that may impede the progress of the team, allowing teams to collaborate more effectively and freely and enhancing the overall success of the group. In addition, I also believe in constant communication, trust, and cooperation while also being responsible for your own tasks. ",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"Volunteering and tutoring weekly at Bear Trax, a program for low-income students, I have worked with kids, many only a couple years younger than I am, that have not received the same educational opportunities that my high school peers and I did.

This team developed my interest in Supreme Court cases and how these decisions have not only changed history but have also impacted our lives today. While I have studied many court cases and their backgrounds and decisions, I have never paid much attention to why these court cases were deemed important enough to be reviewed by the Supreme Court and possible patterns in the reasoning behind these decisions.

I’m a third year studying EECS and data science. I’ve lived in San Diego for all my life, so I’m most comfortable when I’m in warm weather and at the beach. I spend a lot of time watching basketball and also playing it with my friends at the RSF. I’m a big foodie, so naturally, I also like to cook. You’ll also find me playing different video games and watching lots of movies. Of course, given my major, my main interest is technology.

I've worked as a software engineering intern at Viasat and the San Diego Supercomputer Center and will intern at Amazon next summer. My previous work experiences have made me interested in the intersection of fields like health and astronomy with technology. In particular, I've become very interested in data science due to its inherent interdisciplinary nature and growing prominence. I've taken several related courses and decided to pursue the minor after enjoying them. Last spring, I worked on a project through Discovery Research. My key skills include a strong knowledge of Java, Python, and C, with experience in both front-end and back-end web development. I'm also very familiar with data manipulation tools/libraries.","I’ve participated in Discovery Research in the past (Spring 2019) and found both my project and supervisor great. However, my project didn't feel very data science focused and I'd like to work on a project with a programming/analytics emphasis. I've been interested in data science for some time now, but unfortunately a lot of my experience has been restricted to the classroom. I recently took Data 100 and enjoyed it, so leveraging all the skills I developed in the course would be interesting. 

Participating in Discovery Research would be a great opportunity for personal growth, and I know I would do my absolute best to contribute to my assigned project. I would love an opportunity to fully immerse myself in a project that I find genuinely interesting and one in which I can use and develop my data science skills. Making positive contributions to health, technology, and/or science while doing so would be amazing. 

Through the program, I would become acquainted with cutting-edge technology essential to the world today, gain invaluable hands-on research experience, and expand my data analysis skills to become a more proficient data scientist.","The term “team chemistry” is constantly talked about in the world of sports and video games. I think it’s absolutely crucial to any team. It’s not necessarily a tangible thing, but I believe that teamwork is at its best when members of a team trust each other and are comfortable with one another. This doesn't necessarily mean being close friends with all your teammates, but rather, understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and inherent personalities. 

If a specific task needs to be done or a problem arises, team members can immediately know who has the best skill set to take care of it. I’ve also found that people feel more comfortable with giving constructive feedback to someone familiar rather than a stranger. I've found that in general, communication becomes habitual and working as a team becomes fluid and natural. 

Another indicator of my ideal of good teamwork is how a team reacts to problems. A great team shouldn't panic, stress, or place blame in the face of obstacles. They know that they have supportive teammates who can work together calmly to tackle anything. Understanding and befriending my teammates is important to me, so I try my best to embody all these ideals.

Coming out of high school, the only thing I was sure of was that I wanted to learn as much as I possibly could about the things that interest me. I came in as an intended math major, but I quickly realized that pure math was not for me. After I took CS10 in my first semester, I found myself taking more and more CS classes because of how challenging and fulfilling they were. However, I continued to take math classes as I still liked math, and I knew that I would want to take more statistics and math-heavy classes in the future. As a big basketball fan, I knew I wanted to take more courses in statistical analysis, and learn how to analyze data in useful and creative ways. Luckily for me, Data Science is a pretty good fit for someone with my interests.

Beyond Data Science, my coursework also reflects some of my other interests, such as entrepreneurship and East Asian languages and cultures. Being a Chinese American coming from a predominantly white part of California, I did not realize how out of touch I was with my culture until I came to Berkeley. Through my classes and my experiences at Berkeley, I learned a lot about the differences between East Asian and American cultures and values. I was able to finally learn how to read and write Chinese, and i was able to continue my Japanese language education from high school.

My favorite classes at Berkeley come from the IEOR department, in the forms of IEOR 185, Challenge Lab, and IEOR 170, Tech Firm Leadership. Both classes have taught me a lot about how I function on a team, and how to overcome my weaknesses and use my strengths. 
","A professor once said to me that breadth classes are arguably more important than major classes. His point was that although you can learn all the technical knowledge in the world, if you don't have soft skills such as critical thinking, communication, and the ability to work in a team, you will not be successful in the professional field. I think that developing soft skills is something that is often overlooked by many students. It comes from going out of your comfort zone and solving new and challenging problems. For me, I hope to be challenged by participating in the Discovery Research program. I want to solve problems and use the technical knowledge I have gained in creative and interesting ways. ","Everyone has strengths and everyone has weaknesses. The purpose of a team is to combine people's strengths to overcome individual weaknesses. It seems like a flawless system, but anyone who has ever worked on a group project would strongly disagree. In reality, personal conflicts, miscommunication, irresponsibility, and many other problems can plague any team. A good teammate is responsible enough to their part, and do their part well. However, I believe that a good teammate does not assume that just because they are not the ones that cause problems, that problems will not arise elsewhere. Instead, a good teammate should know that problems are inevitable, and that they should work with the team to solve those problems, no matter what the cause may be. At the end of the day, being part of a team means that you are working with other people towards a common goal. It is important for everyone to do as much as they reasonably can to work together and reach that common goal.",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"In high school, I learned to love the American legal system through my time in mock trial. It is a beautiful and complicated beast that is forever living and forever changing. It was created in such a way that it would not move at the swells of a movement, but would move with the tide of an era.

This coming semester (Spring 2020) I will be a CSM Senior Mentor and a Probability 140 Group Tutor. As a result of these positions, I am skilled at digesting and communicating large and complex concepts, creating content with the goal of investigating or explaining an idea, and working with others to a common goal.

Research: I have conducted a variety of research in the past. In Spring 2018, I worked on analyzing data from videos of nanoparticles through the Alivisatos Group. I conducted chemistry research in the Rittle Lab Fall 2018, Spring 2019, and Summer 2019. From this I have learned to analyze a variety of data (video data, scientific data such as NMR, etc.), parse scientific writing and papers, and, ultimately, conduct research.",Yes,"Data 100, CS 61A or E7, CS 61B, CS 70, Math 54 / Stat 89A, Stat 134 or 140/ IEOR 172/ EE 126, CS 188, Philos 140A, Philos 140B, CS 61C, Math 110, CS 170",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1olT7HDngsGV5pJc7U_7AYeCABr1fp2NO,"I have diverse interests. I’ve made a concerted effort to maintain them—chemistry, graphic design, and writing, among others—throughout college. By taking graduate level writing classes, graphic design decals, chemistry classes, and more, I’ve pursued these outside-of-major interests; at the same time, these interests have taught me extremely valuable skills that I would be lacking had I studied just my majors.

Writing is all about relaying information in a clear and concise manner. I developed my communication skills and in turn my ability to explain things in ways that make sense and create content that works from simple ideas to very complex ones.

Graphic design is similar in this aspect—it is also about communication. However, it’s about nonverbal communication; it requires an understanding of how those who interact with it will perceive it. Representational communication has proved itself to be wildly useful for me in all kinds of fields, especially in data representation.

Chemistry requires a very different style of thinking from more analytical fields like data science and math. My career in chemistry has forced me to develop a certain kind of problem-solving oriented thinking that is different from the kind of logical thinking that is more commonly required in computer science. 

I have always been someone with multiple interests, and my dedication to all of them makes me all the more skilled at each and every one of them.","In my two years here at Berkeley, I’ve seen and done a lot; what I haven’t done, however, dwarfs what I have done. And that’s ultimately what I’m here at Berkeley for—experiences. I’ve been able to apply myself to all nature of things to service the community: lab assisting, working at the library, research, course grading, mentoring and tutoring, etc., but I have so far been unable to pursue research in the more mathematical sciences. My tenure as a chemistry researcher was interesting and enriching, but it made me realize that I wanted to work on more rigorous research, where the investigation was more directly tied to the subject being studied.

The investigation of ""new knowledge,"" i.e., research of any kind, has always been important to me. My passions lie in passing in furthering my understanding of the fields that I have studied through reasoning and investigation. I would say that I’ve been exposed to many facets of the research process, but I haven’t been able to directly participate in data science research. The Discovery Research Program allows me to pursue my passion for research in a new and productive way that provides me novel experiences, allows me to learn, and exposes me to new things, while also making a meaningful impact at UC Berkeley. ","Throughout my life I have gained appreciation for perspectives. My own philosophy towards life is molded by this appreciation as I understand that I see things the way that I do only because my life occurred in a certain way that lends me to certain perspectives. My disagreements with others arise because their lives have led them to different perspectives.

Ultimately, this means that every person I meet has some understanding of the world, some set of perspectives, that are different from mine. By working with one another, I can learn about the world under a different light. This means the work done by many is enhanced by the varying perspectives that are brought to it.

It is because of this that I think it is important that everyone contributes in a team. Team dynamics are often complex and many times there are people who are heard too little, or not heard in the correct way. To make the product of teamwork the best it can be, it is important that every perspective that comes to it is considered. 

For me, this means that everyone must be given the chance to be heard, and perhaps even pushed to be heard even if it is outside of their comfort zone. At the same time, others on the team must be conscientious of this; they need to make sure that their behavior on the team does not mean that the contributions of others go unseen or unresolved.",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"This project interests me the most because its high level of abstraction. It works on a more theoretical level to develop algorithms that can be applied at an abstract level to graphs and unstructured data.

My data science career sprouted from taking interest in several areas -- biology/public health, environmental science, education, and government -- and a general interest to find truth in the world through a mathematical approach. I recognized data science as a pathway to all those fields --  an intersection between my academic and personal interests. Because of this, I’ve been active in projects that have helped me explore those interests, from creating a database for Supreme Court transcripts, to creating a product for California public water systems, to building SIR models to predict where fires may spread. These experiences have helped me understand the importance of my work, my level of expertise, and how data driven approaches can provide significant value in many areas of academia and the workforce.

Outside of Data Science, I enjoy watching documentaries and listening to podcasts (my favorite is HiddenBrain from NPR!). I think they provide just the right amount of perspective, education, and inspiration for me to learn something new and apply it to my current situation. I also write short stories, usually based off true events in my own life. Whenever I think of an experience worth documenting, I usually write multiple versions to capture the different ways of perceiving the event. I enjoy challenging myself to view my story through different narratives, and although I prefer my stories to be objective and accurate, I also want to see how many different ways I can misconstrue my own truth and see how it may change over time. I find it helps me in my work as a data scientist, understanding how underlying process of collecting, processing, visualizing, and modeling data can create a complete different story depending on how you approach each step.","This summer I had the opportunity to work at the Bureau of Labor Statistics as a Data Science Fellow, and through my project I learned to view data science in a holistic manner --  I learned how to do data science for stakeholders, specifically, adopting design approaches to quickly assess the needs and goals of the project, communicating with my managers on what was and wasn’t a realistic expectation, and heavily considering how the outcomes of the project may affect people who use the product. This experience taught me that data science is not always about building a fancy tool, and has inspired me to build data-driven systems that focus on every aspect of the process, not just the modelling. I have had the privilege of participating in the data collection, cleaning, and product-building process through the discovery program, and I would like the opportunity to continue doing so. I feel that my recent experience has taught me several lessons -- from unique data science techniques to dealing with the user needs -- that aren’t part of the classroom curriculum, and I would like the opportunity to share my knowledge to the team and future researchers.
","In my previous research projects I took on a more leadership role. When working on a team, I first identify how I fit into the group and where my skills would be most helpful. I like to take initiative and make sure the team has an efficient workflow, so I usually end up facilitating a discussion on what the best approach to completing the project is, evaluating other people’s opinions on what they want to do versus what they can do. Apart from handling logistical issues, I do enjoy working on the technical aspects of the project. I communicate constantly to ensure that my teammates and I are on the same page -- from simple documentation, to error/logic checking, to suggesting design ideas for the end product. I learned through my previous projects that a team works best when they have a safe environment. When I work on a team, I try to create a community where students feel happy to be working and comfortable sharing ideas. I find that when students are offered an opportunity to discuss their viewpoint and supporting arguments, or can teach a few things, it not only helps them feel like they’re contributing, but it also helps the rest of the group grow, stay on the same page, and lead to even more ideas. I aim to foster open communication and excitement towards the project as opposed to simply assigning tasks without further discussion.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"Although my understanding of the domain is limited, I find that it does not necessarily impede the progress of my work or reduce my interest in the field. My previous projects are very different (government, water, solar panels, etc.), but I successfully completed each one with the help of an expert I could consult and work with. I am interested in this project for two reasons: impact/value and growth potential. By impact, I refer to public health and the rise of external (and internal) factors that lead to cardiovascular disease. I believe any research in biology and medicine is necessary and important, and cardiovascular disease is an excellent choice of research, as it is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. that needs further attention. I’ve experienced working on data science projects where the results end up getting forgotten or dropped, or they’re for a cause I do not believe is inherently useful (i.e. increasing company revenue, gaining more customers, etc.). These projects have motivated me to seek work where there is intrinsic value and clear impact. In regards to growth potential, I love that this project requires independence from the individual. I have often found that my work is most lucrative when given the freedom to make decisions and research on my own. Though I frequently ask questions for guidance/logic checking and can follow directions when assigned, I enjoy being a self starter and leading a project from start to finish, and I believe I could contribute greatly if given the opportunity. I am driven by my own learning and discoveries, and would like to work on a team that has similar motivations.
",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"Social media platforms were designed to connect people, not make them feel more lonely. As the number of users rise over the years, so has the amount of mental health problems associated with this usage. Though this phenomenon can be attributed to several factors, there’s no doubt that language and interaction has a huge effect on it. The project description makes a good point in mentioning how inclusive communities deserves just as much attention as detecting hate speech. I’m interested in this project because I believe there’s so much to learn in how people interact online and discovering what makes a community truly inclusive. How does the number of reactions, comments, and types of comments affect the community online? (for example, does a high number of upvotes in a negative subreddit comment indicate that the subreddit tends to have toxic members?) How can you tell when a comment thread is engaging in a friendly or harmful way? What are the effects of these interactions on the user? Do they tend to be more or less active afterwards? These questions are very interesting because it’s difficult to engage the tone and attitude remotely, and though I could go on, I would rather jump to the most important questions, which I hope to learn and solve through this project. In addition, as a frequent user of these platforms, I tend to find myself wondering both online and offline how to keep a community inclusive. It can be hard enough to make everyone feel like they belong in a group of friends (depending on the people), but online people can be anything they want. I’m very curious to see if there are any parallels between these two very different worlds, and if there’s any way to develop a guide for the online world. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"The cannabis industry has soared in the last few years thanks to progressive legislation; however, with it comes several cultural and political factors that surround this sensitive drug that is causing prices to fluctuate. As someone who views cannabis from a more progressive standpoint, I think it’s important to understand how these prices are being influenced by these factors. Whether medicinal or recreational, cannabis has helped many people get through the rough parts of life, and I’d like to be able to explore how prices are affecting the customers. I’m interested in this project because I believe this is a market that doesn’t have enough research due to the political sensitivities surrounding it, and I can be a valuable contribution to the team. In my last internship, I had to analyze products for the Consumer Price Index using their product descriptions and prices. I used various NLP techniques to achieve the model I wanted, and was able to classify whether or not a product needed to be reviewed by a commodity analyst. Though this cannabis project is not necessarily a classification problem, I spent weeks cleaning the data and ensuring that the code I created was reproducible and easy to read for future analysis and applications. I researched NLP techniques on my own and was successfully able to apply my individual research into my work. I believe the skills and work ethic I learned from these previous projects and internships have allowed me to keep up to speed with other students while also bringing new ideas to the table through individual discoveries.

I came to Cal aspiring to the field of medicine. I thought my time here would solely revolve around chemicals, test tubes, and yeast models. While I love all that genetics and medical programs have to offer, I found it difficult to commit myself to an industry where I could only help one person at a time. Although being a doctor is an incredible and vital profession, I was searching for something that could scale medical advancements globally, and not just through one person at a time. After taking computer programming, statistics, and data courses, I had realized that genetics could be so much better served with the help of data analysis. Genomes could be analyzed at a rapid pace,  patterns that only computers can find could be used to show predispositions for diseases, and eventually, computers themselves could correctly diagnose most patients. Combining these two fields is where my passions lie. There are no medical advancements without data. In the near future, data scientists and geneticists will work together to remedy the worlds most pressing health issues. I’m beyond thrilled that my studies at Cal have given me the opportunity to partake in this medical revolution.  ","Through the discovery program, I hope to find a project which challenges and strengthens my knowledge of what I’ve learned in the classroom. In the past 8 months I’ve conducted research in Professor Koshland’s lab, I’ve visually seen how abstract genetic models that seem of little importance on paper are vital to recognizing chromosome abnormalities in the lab. This experience has shown me how academic fulfillment isn’t quite complete until you see something carried out in a tangible manner. In working on a data driven project, I hope to gain the same revelations in the discovery research program. I would love to be part of a project where I can witness and work on machine learning and data manipulation algorithms. This way, I can see exactly what sorts of skills are necessary to get real life results, rather than classroom simulated ones. ","After taking Bioengineering 100 this past fall, I’ve thought a lot about my moral code and how it comes into effect in collaborating with others. My approach to teamwork relies heavily on the concept of balance. Throughout my academic career,  I’ve done well to transform my inherent people pleasing personality and stand up for my opinion on certain topics. Through this improving skill, I make sure to present and stand by my viewpoints even if they are not in line with the majority of the group. On the other hand, I believe it to be equally as important to keep a genuine open mind and absorb what others around me have to say. By internalizing others’ opinions, it not only improves my stances, but sheds light onto imperative viewpoints I haven’t considered. In addition, making sure others feel valued and safe to express their stance is crucial to working in a harmonious environment. By keeping these two essential principals in check with one another, I have successfully navigated my way through working with a group. ",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"This project is incredible in how it utilizes data driven approaches to remedy a lack of information. It’s fascinating to see how these researchers are utilizing NLP and existing data to create something pertinent out of a lack of information. This project is incredibly in line with my interests. As I mentioned in earlier statements, my primary goal for academic research is to utilize data and genomics to help better the field of medicine on a massive scale. I am looking for a project that uses data driven approaches, such as NLP, as well as existing genomic information to enact massive changes within the facets of healthcare. This project is improving efficiency, minimizing inaccurate diagnostics, and saving precious lives through its commitment towards recognizing patterns in data. In addition, I love this project since it affects those who are underserved in the community around me. By having this tangible pressure of improving my own community, I am even more motivated to connect the dots between imperative patterns within tumors. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"This project is fascinating since it involves AI detection of patterns within heart disease patients. Heart failures are some of the largest contributors to death world wide. However, with all of this data from millions of patients, we still have not seemed to find a bulletproof method of preventing cardiovascular failures. Training an intelligent AI seems a very promising direction for nearly fail-proof detection of at-risk individuals.

I loved seeing how much information I could glean from a seemingly innocuous table of numbers. My first tangentially related experience with data science apart from this class before college came with the M3 Math Modelling Challenge. My team and I were given an observation to prove and 14 hours to write a reasonably well researched paper proving or disproving the topic. Although this was in the midst of peak sernioritis, spending 14 hours attempting to fit the data to different predictive models and drawing conclusions from our attempts felt more like second nature rather than meaningless school work. Being given the title of National Honorable Mention (Top <5%) only confirmed what all of us had learned within those 14 hours: data science was our calling.","Through participating in Discovery Research, I hope to sharpen the skills and knowledge I gained in both Data 8 and CS 61a and realize their application in the real world. Being a freshman in college, I don't feel ready to enter the industry just yet, and I feel like being part of a research project can help me feel more confident in my abilities, by allowing me to work alongside industry professionals, professors and grad students. Additionally, working on a research topic that is loosely related to my current major can allow me to explore horizons that I otherwise wouldn't have. ","I love working in small group settings where each person's voice isn't drowned out, but rather heard. I believe that there really is no 'I' in team, and that each individual brings something unique to the table. I've often found that in teams where the members weren't forced into doing the task, each individual shines brighter than they would alone.

I have worked as a volunteer teaching weekly health workshops to 9th grade students in under-resourced high schools throughout the Bay Area for 3 and a half years with the goal of increasing health equity. My experience providing a direct service to my students has been incredibly rewarding and energizes my passion for promoting tangible enhancements to population health. In the fall of 2018 completed an upper division course in Probability and Statistics for Biology and Public Health that I found to be incredibly exciting and engaging. This course ignited my ambition to develop my statistical, programming, and analytical skills and ultimately apply them to research that optimizes health outcomes and improves the lives of others. I worked as a research assistant for the UC Berkeley Center for Healthcare Organizational and Innovation Research which is operated through UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. This past summer I participated in Boston University’s Institute for Research Education in Biostatistics which provided me with training and hands on experience employing the skills and knowledge required to be a practicing Biostatistician. In addition to my interests in population health and data science, I have also had a lifelong involvement in the arts. I began taking dance classes when I was 8 years old and have continued to take classes or perform in a company every year since then. This upcoming semester I will be taking ballet. I also have a passion for drawing and painting and always find time to create whether I am taking an art class or practicing independently.","Through participating in the Discovery Research program I hope to develop my data science skills and gain experience applying them to a real-world project related to population health. While I have contributed a research project in the past, I am eager to take on a more technical role and work on a project that aligns with my interests more directly. I plan to pursue an MPH in Epidemiology/Biostatistics and ultimately work for a government agency where my health research discoveries can be applied towards protecting populations from disease and promoting the mobilization of public health programs. I hope that my experience participating in the Discovery Research program will help prepare me with skills and experience that will aid my success in this endeavor or provide me with insight into whether this path that I intend to pursue is a good fit for me.","I think that it is important to make space for every team member’s ideas and establish effective communication norms from the start. I know that when I work on a team, I feel more invested in the success of the project when I feel that my ideas are being heard and given genuine consideration by my colleagues. Consequently, I approach teamwork with the intent of being an active and open-minded listener. I have an awareness of my current strengths and weaknesses.

My high school had no programming courses so I took an intro to programming course in community college and it spurred me to try out Computer Science at Cal, starting with participation in the CS Scholars Program. CS 61A discouraged me a little, but it was CS 61B and Data 8 my freshman spring where I had decided this was the path I wanted to continue. I declared the Computer Science Major fall of 2018 and have taken theoretical CS, statistical, and data-related classes since. I find myself applying to research opportunities so that I have hands-on experience working on a research project with the support and guidance of mentors. I would use this experience to both prepare for graduate research work and to be competitive in Masters programs in either CS or Statistics. ","Most importantly, I wish to gain important research experience, complete with the support and mentorship of an adviser/mentor. This is my third year here, and while I have taken a decent amount of upper-division classes and understood what I would like to specialize in, I would like to use my knowledge to contribute to a paper and/or research project. I can gain useful experience that would better prepare me for graduate school. This is why I want to participate in Discovery Research.","With teamwork, I believe experiences can vary widely depending on the chemistry of the team. With proper communication, a team can delegate tasks to people who specialize in or are more comfortable in that assignment. Therefore, I would communicate clearly and frequently so that I don’t hold the team behind and I can help or get help from the right person at the right time. Especially in a setting where people are available at different times (students taking classes during the semester), meeting with the group regularly is something that I would encourage.",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"This project combines two of my biggest interests in Computer and Data Science, combining data analytics with theoretical computer science. This project would give me the PERFECT opportunity to build a model with a team that aims to tackle a particular limitation (streaming data). I have long desired to build a model since I learned of 538's election models (which was one of my main reasons for choosing CS in the first place); CS 170 (algorithms and theoretical CS) was one of my favorite classes at Berkeley and since then I have deeply fascinated with several problems that computer scientists have and are tackling.

From the intensity of the games to the electricity of the crowds, needless to say, following the sport was a hobby. What intrigued me most about the NBA was seeing the points scored, rebounds snatched, and assists delivered. Whenever I missed a game, I meticulously studied these stats and it eventually became a habit. As an avid fan, I am inspired by the growth in technology and the role of Data Science and Statistics that the NBA has implemented since my first time watching.
I was first introduced to Computer Science during my junior year of high school where I became a summer researcher at the California State University, Bakersfield. I spent weeks learning to program in Java and more specifically working on an Object-oriented Android application. That summer, my exposure to Computer Science led me to realize my genuine interest in programming and the numerous fields I could combine my newfound fascination with.
I am truly inspired by the role Data Science plays and is utilized in real-world applications, and because of that, I hope to take on a hands-on approach to the field that I will be able to carry with me into the industry for years to come.","As a current Freshman in the College of Letters and Science, I found the diversity of potential majors to choose from both encouraging and daunting. I have held interests in many fields that it has made it difficult for me to decide on a single major. I intend to study Data Science during my time here. However, I have a variety of interests that I hope to combine in conjunction with my major. 
By participating in the Discovery Research, I believe that I will harness these key skills necessary to Data Science while exposing myself to other fields that work to collaborate with and better understand the underlying details of the subject. In addition to exposure to unique subjects, I hope to improve upon my soft skills in a professional environment.
 A program like this allows me to work with similar-minded individuals in order to accomplish a common goal. I find the research topics offered this semester particularly fascinating and hope to gain exposure to unfamiliar fields while utilizing Data Science and analyzation. 
","Before I explain my approach, I have my own definition of teamwork. It is the idea of constant interaction with individuals using each of their given skills in order to build and work towards an objective. I believe that individuals who work together and perform their own strengths will boost productivity long-term. When each teammate is delegated a particular role rather than multiple roles that stray outside of their realm of specialty, the overall output and efficiency declines. In addition to it, I am a strong believer of consistent cooperation and critiquing in an effort to hold a team to a high standard. A team should be able to give feedback, negative or positive, to hone in on what should be continued and what should be solved. I approach teamwork in the sense that I hold myself to do not what is convenient for myself but what is in the end logical for the sake of the group. Over time, I hope to do my part in building the team’s overall chemistry in the work environment. All in all, I approach teamwork as a way to do my part in surpassing goals.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"The Pricing norms in cannabis markets project stands out to me as I will be able to venture into the Economics aspect of a rapidly growing product. I believe that restructuring and interpreting data is a significant skill to Data Science that will be essential to me as I take my knowledge into the industry. This type of project allows me to apply Data Science to a real-world application in regards to Economics and the inner workings of the cannabis market. Furthermore, it would allow me to improve upon my soft skills while working with a team as well as developing a stronger foundation in Data Science. This project also caught my eye because it not only involves Economics, it takes an analytical approach to a culturally relevant commodity. I plan on majoring in Data Science, but I also intend to combine this subject with another field of interest. I would be able to explore the realm of Economics and how Data Science is intertwined alongside it. ",Kiwibot delivery robots," I am interested in gaining a hands-on point of view of a start-up company utilizing Data Science. I believe that collaborating with a company like Kiwibot would be a way for me to work with a smaller organization and improve upon my soft skills in a workplace. I truly am interested in viewing Data Science applied as a part of a real-world application. Furthermore, I hope to see the ins and outs of a company from the opposite end of my current point of view and work alongside goal-oriented peers.  In addition, I find the overall concept of Kiwibot an innovative one, and it would allow me to take in key skills that I will be able to take into the industry. With it being a relatively new company, I am especially enthusiastic to take on more responsibility as a researcher of the project. I believe the project plays a meaningful role in the company’s day-to-day operations and want to gain more experience in regards to viewing the company’s scaling. ",Exploratory cross-linguistic analysis of acoustic data,"Alongside my interest in Data Science, I have an interest in language as an amateur screenwriter. To me, the Cross-linguistic analysis project would be a great combination given my background as well as my willingness to undergo a hands-on approach to Data Science analyzing language.

Last semester, I was the Lab assistant for Data 8. I got the chance to review the concepts that I learned from Data 8. I also improve my communication skills by teaching the student how to approach one questions without revealing the answer straightly. This experience helps deepen my knowledge by learning different ways to approach the same question. I also took two Econ classes last semester because I like to learn more about the Economic trend. Data analyzing skills are helpful for making marketing decision. Right now I am trying to learn more coding languages, like Tableau and Spreadsheet, on myself.  ","This is my last semester studied at Berkeley, but I feel like I still lack of some experience outside of school. Before I work as full time, I wish I can explore more about Data Science through this Discovery Research. The research program contains so many opportunities in various areas, which are great for learning and gaining experience from outside of school. I am not that clear what I can do in the future and how can I improve myself in order to contribute to the society. I believe this research can help me to find those answers. Also, I wish I can meet more people who have the similar interests with me. I can improve myself more by learning from different individuals. ","For the coding project, if the team have enough time, my ideal way for teamwork is all the teammates can try to do the project individually. When one teammate stuck at a part, the others who figured out can offer help. The whole team help each other during the project. In this way, all the teammates can know what they are doing. After everyone finish the project, we can compare and select the most ideal one to submit as teamwork. If the team does not have enough time, all the teammate should gather together and divide parts for everyone. However, it’s better to pick the time that teammates can meet up in person. Teamwork that divided by parts is less efficient than doing each part alone. After everyone finished, we can organize the whole work and discuss if there is anything need to be fixed.  ",Data Visualization for User Experience,"User experience are extremely important to a startup because the users determine how long a startup can survive. In this Internet world, people have various choices over a single product. If one product does not have better quality or is less convenience, this product might be easily substitute by others. If a startup does not analyzing and discussing the user experience, they cannot improve their project, which makes the startup will be easily outdated. This is also the reason that collecting and analyzing the user experiences are important for a startup. I would like to learn more the process of visualizing the data on this program by getting access to the real-world industry applications and applying data visualization.    ",Student Success Analytics Platform,"I am interested on accessing to the student dataset and get the chance to creating the algorithms for predicting student success.

Once we can get a reasonable prediction of the student database, we can use it and help more undergraduate student to succeed. The goal of school is making more student succeed on what they passionate about. The prediction is not only helping more students but also help the society because there are more people become a better person through learning the important parts to succeed.

Throughout all my years in school prior to college, I had an interest in subjects like math and science, especially calculus and statistics. Something about the technicality of the subjects really attracted me to them, for there always seemed to be a way to draw a logical conclusion. However, despite growing up in Silicon Valley, I wasn’t exposed to subjects such as data science and computer science until coming to UC Berkeley. The same qualities that drew me to math and science translated to these subjects, for I admire the major presence of logical and inferential thinking while solving problems. 

Another interest I’ve picked up while here at Berkeley is pedagogy. I have been a learning assistant for Data 8 for the past two semesters and really enjoy being able to not only share the knowledge I have acquired as a student, but to also enhance my own understanding of the subject through teaching. 

Outside of academics, I volunteer as a mentor to elementary school students, a hobby I’ve had since middle school.","One of the main reasons I’d like to participate in Discovery Research this semester is to improve and build upon the skills that I have gained throughout my past few semesters at Berkeley. Joining Berkeley Data Science Society last semester as a general member has led me to realize that I have a genuine passion for the subject outside of the classroom setting, and I would love to participate in a more in-depth project. Another thing I hope to gain is the experience of collaborating with a new group of people, for learning to work towards a common goal with a team is a very important skill needed to succeed in the professional world. I also really enjoy the camaraderie of working with a team, so this aspect of Discovery Research would be great for connecting with people with similar interests! Lastly, I hope to gain the satisfaction of knowing that I have contributed to a project that will hopefully improve the world that we live in through the power of research and data science.","When you are working on a team, you need to be able to pull your own fair share of weight. However, in my opinion, you need to be willing to pull not only your share of weight, but more than that as well. This is because there will be some days when your fellow teammates may be experiencing difficulties in completing their assigned tasks due to their given circumstances. As their teammate, you must be willing to sacrifice your time to help them out, and hope that the rest of your team would do the same for you in a similar situation. Being able to empathize and compromise with others is another important factor of teamwork. Without these qualities, a team will not be able to function smoothly and will be hindered by interpersonal issues, ultimately interfering with the main goal of the team. When I’m working on a team, I always make sure to befriend and become acquainted with my teammates, for this not only improves productivity but also makes the overall experience much more enjoyable. However, you must also be able to voice your opinions and not be afraid to speak up for what you believe is best for the team.",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,"The initial reason this project interested me is because it sounded similar to a project that I have done before in a data science class. In that project, our task was to analyze the correlation between diet and cardiovascular disease given a set of medical data. Although the objective for this project is definitely different, I think that the concepts of the aforementioned project will translate well to comparing the effectiveness of medicine for those with Crohn's disease. Another aspect of the project that interests me is that we will be analyzing raw data rather than data from a randomized control trial. This seems like an interesting challenge that I am definitely up to face. I have contributed to data cleaning for a past project in Berkeley Data Science Society, and am interested in how the raw data can be polished and utilized to imitate the impact of a randomized control trial. Lastly, I’m interested in this project because its implications and results have the ability to truly benefit people struggling with this disease. My previous experiences in data science lead me to believe that I would be able to meaningfully contribute to a project that could help those with Crohn’s disease. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"This project initially interested me because I noticed that it used Python, a language that I have been working with since my first semester at Berkeley and have grown to be quite comfortable with using. It also interests me because I have experience in data cleaning from a previous project with Berkeley Data Science Society, which appears to be an important aspect of the project. I also have basic experience in formulating classifiers from a project that I have done before in a data science class, which involved creating a k-nearest neighbor classifier to identify movie genres given a script from the movie. While this project has an entirely different scope, I believe that the concepts applied from the aforementioned project will transfer well to this one, since they both involve identifying common patterns. I also procured an interest in product management after taking an introductory business class, and would love to be able to see how data science is used in collaboration with business. Lastly, the political and cultural elements that affect the cannabis industry in the United States are very interesting to me, particularly when it comes to their impacts on medical versus recreational cannabis products.",Kiwibot delivery robots,"This project initially interested me because it involves a machine that seems to have become an integral part of the UC Berkeley experience: the Kiwibot. Being able to participate in estimating delivery times that optimize customer satisfaction seems like an experience that is not only fun and interesting, but also one that will result in lots of education and growth. Learning techniques to estimate an optimal delivery time is something that is very interesting to me. In previous classes, I have learned basic estimation techniques, such as linear regression, and would be very grateful to be able to deepen my understanding and/or learn new strategies. I’d also like the opportunity to learn about data that helps to measure correlation between customer satisfaction and delivery time, because this is likely universal to many other products and services. Learning how to analyze and improve user experience is something that is very beneficial to know, not only for Kiwibots but for other technologies as well. However, the fact that this project in particular involves working with Kiwibots makes it even more interesting to me, and I would love to be able to enhance the experience of those around me at UC Berkeley and other college campuses that Kiwibots cater to.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,Facebook,No,1,

In math, there is no shortage of strange or fantastic ideas to study and satisfy one's curiosity. Math also has the wonderful knack of turning in up where one may not expect it to. When I'm not reading a math textbook, I'm usually studying Spanish or music. Surprisingly, I've found mathematical thinking can be well applied to these subjects. In music, language and math, one is constrained by certain pre-defined rules, such as conventions of musical composition, grammar, or the axioms of a vector space. Yet, within these constraints one has infinite creative power. In this way, studying math has given me a different perspective on these subjects and has allowed me to appreciate them in a different way. For this reason, I enjoy trying to apply mathematical thinking to the various subjects I encounter in my academic or personal life.","By participating in Discovery Research, I hope to learn how my robust background in math can be applied to data science. I'm an applied math major, so when I approach a new subject, I enjoy looking for insights by trying to frame new ideas within a mathematical context. Unfortunately, many of the math courses I've taken focus more on the ""math"" than the ""applied."" As I've seen from courses like Data 8 and others, the theories and techniques of data science lend themselves to being understood and appreciated within a mathematical context. Though one can use data science techniques without understanding their mathematical context, I believe one can better use and appreciate those techniques if the mathematical context is understood. I am interesting in Discovery Research because I believe I can bring mathematical thinking to a Discovery Project, situating it within a mathematical context and thereby contributing a unique perspective to the project.","I work best with a team when individual preparation is combined with team productivity. What I mean by this is best illustrated by example. When working with a partner on a computer science project last fall, I would study the content of the project on my own time. In this sense, I prepared individually. When I met with my partner, I had a strong enough understanding of the project content that I could then effectively collaborate with my partner and make progress toward completing the project. In this sense, I reserved productivity for a team setting. I thought this type of teamwork was effective. By preparing individually but working on the project together, my partner and I were able to brainstorm and debug much more efficiently than if we had worked separately on different components of the project. This method of individual preparation combined with team productivity is an approach that I enjoy and one that I would look to use in future team settings.",Thermal Unit Characterization Based on Data,"I am interested in this project because it is an opportunity for me to connect my background in mathematics to the field of renewable energy. As a math major, I've loved studying many fascinating topics in math, but it hasn't been clear how I may use my appreciation for math in a meaningful way. Renewable energy is a field where math can applied to make a lasting impact. I firmly believe that the widespread development of abundant and renewable energy will lead to significant progress in many areas of society, so I am excited by the possibility of contributing to this field.

As an applicant with a robust background in math, my greatest strength is my comfort with quantification and my ability to learn new technical concepts by framing them within a mathematical context. As this project requests, I am familiar with least-squares regression, both on a practical and theoretical level. I have taken several classes where I have completed projects involving least-squares regression, but I have also taken several courses in linear algebra where I've explored the rigorous mathematics behind least-squares. While I have not been exposed to piece-wise least-squares or integer programming, I am confident my background in mathematics and my elective coursework in computer science will allow me to learn enough of these topics to be an effective project contributor.

I believe that the potential for abundant renewable energy is a potential solution to many current societal problems in addition to environmental ones, such as global warming. I am excited that I may be able to use my background in mathematics to contribute to this vital field.",BEACO2N,"I am interested in this project because it is an opportunity for me to connect my background in math to the field of renewable energy and urban development. As a math major, I've loved studying many fascinating topics in math, but it hasn't been clear how I may use my appreciation for math in a meaningful way. Renewable energy and urban development are fields where math can applied to make a lasting impact. I firmly believe that the widespread development of abundant and renewable energy and the sustainable development of urban landscapes will lead to significant progress in many areas of society. I am excited by the possibility of using my background to contribute simultaneously to these important fields.

Based on the project description, it seems likely that this project will require data cleaning and visualization. When I took UC Berkeley's ""Foundations of Data Science"" course, I enrolled in a connector-course which connected data science to the field of criminal justice. In that connector-course, I learned how to clean and manage less-than-desirable public data-sets from the California Department of Justice and present the data using basic visualization tools like MatPlotLib. Were I part of this project, I would draw on those skills to clean data and create effective visualizations.

More specifically, I want to use my knowledge in math and data science to make an impact in the global development sector. Outside of Data Science, I enjoy doing volunteer work. For instance, last summer, I have co-created a summer camp STEM curriculum for the native youth in Ukiah and spent three weeks there leading the summer camp. Besides volunteer work, I enjoy learning through podcasts and reading books. Working in the non-profit sector not only requires technical skills(math/data science) but also needs miscellaneous knowledge on psychology, business... For instance, recently I read Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die. This book talks about how to convey messages and ideas for targeted audience such that they will likely to remember your message. This is a very important skill to have, especially for data scientists. I believe that through constant reading and learning outside of class, I am becoming a more well-rounded data scientist. ","To begin with, I want to sharpen my skill as a data scientist. I am interested in developing a more solid framework of how I approach complex datasets to solve problems. I have no prior research experience, so I am really looking forward to this opportunity! In addition, working in a group setting would allow me to hone my teamwork skills(communication, team support, problem solving, listening and feedback, conflict management).  Last but not least, I want to meet and make friends with more aspiring data scientists.
","To begin with, communication is the most important aspect in teamwork. More specifically, one should be able to freely express and exchange their ideas and reflect on events and interactions that took place. For example, when I was co-leading the Native American youth STEM summer camp along with 6 other people, we would have daily lunch meetings, where we would discuss and reflect how things went. We denote that meeting a safe space, where people can freely express their feelings or opinions. Everyone would take turns to write down unique constructive criticisms on a whiteboard and we would then go over the board together to find ways to improve the STEM camp. I found this approach inclusive because everyone gets to express their feelings and ideas freely without any judgement. Having a safe space like this in a team is incredibly valuable.
In addition, having team support is another essential aspect. In terms of managing unforeseen conflicts, team support plays a vital role to ensure the timely progress of the project. In the case of the STEM summer camp, one of the team members had to take few days off due to her family emergency. The team then divided her daily tasks and spread them across the remaining members. Team support is really about everyone stepping up to take responsibility for others in case of unforeseen circumstances. When others have your back, the team is unified.
Last but not least, listening and feedback skills are the most underrated aspect of teamwork. Often times, one would think that he/she understands what the other person is saying so that he/she never asks the other person to clarify anything. For instance, during a hackathon, our UI designer person was taking about some big design idea she learned from class. Everyone seemed to understand and approve of that design idea, so we gave her the green light to implement it. We later found out that our expectation did not match with the reality. We thought we were listening, but we were really not because we didn’t ask her to clarify her idea with concrete examples. We ended up wasting a lot of time there.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"I am very passionate about data science projects that seek to address social issues. This project really strikes home with me. Last summer, I co-created and led a STEM summer camp, where I was very fortunate to work with some low-income native youth for three weeks. I really loved my experience and hope to work on more youth related projects. Working with youth in the summer has made me realized that it is extremely important to help create a safe and sound environment for youth to develop because it is during these years that the kids are starting to create a life-narrative for themselves and these life-narratives will likely to stick with them through out their lives. Einstein once said: ""The most important decision we make is whether we believe we live in a friendly or hostile universe"". If the homeless youth happen to construct a ""hostile"" narrative due to spatial violence and injustice, then that narrative may eventually become the centerpiece of their lives and create suboptimal life situations for them. Thus this project is very crucial and I really want to be a part of it!

Despite having little to no problems when it comes to academic, graduated top of my class — I got rejected by all four universities I applied. I attended community college after, spending time in school an unclear goal in mind. During this period, I competed in video game tournaments with people from around the world as competitive gaming was a hobby of mine.  Unexpectedly, my cat  passed away in 2016. I first found him sleeping and got to my daily routine with no worry in mind, not knowing what happened. I blamed myself for not knowing. That incident triggered a memory I wanted to forget, the death of a cat I had in 2010 that I considered myself as the cause of that death, for not knowing how to treat the wound until it was too late. These incidents made me realize my love for animals — It shaped my mindset and who I am today. they are the motivation and scars that remind me of why I want to become a veterinarian. 

","Through participating in Discovery Research, I am hoping to dive myself in the world of data science, improve my efficiency with data as a whole, and being able to contribute my knowledge and abilities for research. When I first learned about Data Science and the story behind it, it was deemed too late for me to do anything when I got into Cal as a transfer student. I have wanted to take a course to learn about it, but being a DSP student with a limit on time at Cal, I was not able to fit it in my schedule. I truly believe the Discovery Research Program could be the push, the motivation I need to tackle on this. Through the program, I hope to learn about programming, a more in depth route when it comes to analyze data, and utilize these information to improve work and more. I want to utilize the skills I learn from this program to push for a more sustainability world. ","Being the team Captain for a athletic-team recognized by the school, my approach to teamwork consists of 3 steps. The first step is to identify and recognize the strength and weakness of all team members and divide the appropriate work for each team member. The second step for me is to see what skills and characteristics that the team member share and to group them into smaller groups. Not only this will help them to know each other better, it also gives them a space to share their experience and collaboration with each other. I used this method to approach the team I am leading, and the result for it is players have a better mental health and more willing to practice outside of practice time. The last step for my approach to teamwork is to combine everything together and set out plan as a whole to achieve our goal. The purpose of the first two steps are mini steps, they assist each other to build the foundation, the trust in each other, and a good work atmosphere in the team. What I have now is team of people and players that are more open to share their ideas, concerns, and more to everyone in the group.

I was once ignorance on these issues and not caring for it. It was until I learned about how devastated the world can be if I and thousands, millions of people not changing our thoughts. That professor of mine was the one that inspired and taught me the important of the environment, one that decided to educate the young generation in hope for a better future. Since then, I have changed my way of life for a more sustainability world. Because of this and the passion for environmental justices he passed on me, getting to work on this project is a personal goal of mine. It is a topic that I know I will devote the sweat and time in to complete it.

I was a part of a new program , Nav Cal, with a goal to help with students in the same situation, unaware of what I am missing out, to make connection with allies and collaborate to discover and help each other for success. Being a mentor for that program, I realized how much Berkeley needs to work on helping students to find opportunities available. Coming from a low-income, first gen, immigrant, and part of DSP, I understand the hardship of those coming from the same background, and how unprepared I was when it comes to this. Lots of students I know of don't even know about research programs such as the McNair or Firebaugh.

I just didn’t get it at that time. We live in such a medically advanced society – so why hadn’t we saved my best friend? I was determined to find out.  Slowly, I worked my way through all the medical journals I could access and started building a peripheral view of the mechanism of leukemia and other hard-to-cure diseases. Those independent studies gave me the courage to apply for Hanyang University’s LIMLET (LIposome Made LEthal to Tumor cell) capstone project, and helped me understand its significance to the field. It was my first hands on experience that actually made me feel that I was devoted .
Moreover, I recently gained interested in artificial intelligence. The unlimited potential of artificial intelligence development fascinates me and leads me to wonder how far we can go with it. I extended my interest about AI and started to participate in different projects related to AI. My first experience with AI started in developing an Tetris AI with aspiring project members in KSEA. My main task was to write simple code for the game functions and user interfaces using Python. I expressed my interest in AI to the public by publishing few scientific journals and columns dealt with AI topics in Berkeley Opinion. Most recently, I was in charge of developing and AI helper chatbot for a data security software program in FASOO using chatscript. These experiences had let me set path in my data science career leading me to pursue in cognition/AI for domain emphasis. 
","What I glimpsed during my internship and courses was only a brief glimpse of the need of data science skill at work, but it was enough to focus my attention specifically towards the field of data science. Now I seek an environment where I can immerse myself into data science based research that will one day contribute to new breakthroughs and understand the world better. Although I have already enjoyed the privilege of conducting research at Hanyang University lab and developing a software at a data security company called FASOO, it is no doubt that Discovery Research will affect me significantly by becoming the first step into my data science career. 
The desirable benefit that I want to gain through participating in Discovery Research is getting the sense of understanding unknown areas of the world using datas science skills. The aspect of data science that thrills me the most is that it allows us to harness the seemingly unorganized data and process them into a useful information to help understand the world around us better. I believe that this research opportunity will allow me to experience that aspect of data science better than any other past experiences. 
I would also like to meet some aspiring students pursuing in data science and would like to gain insight and learn on techniques of how others perform same tasks differently. Through past internship and research projects, I realized that collaborating together as a team makes a great intimacy with my peers that felt different from getting along with students in class itself. All my past experiences were based on my interest outside of data science, so I sincerely wanted to be in part of a data science based community. Therefore, I believe the Discovery Research may provide an opportunity for me to form a network with students that are also interested in data science.  
","Efficiency is the key for a successful teamwork. The merit of working as a team depends on how much a team can effectively accomplish a work in a given time, so I believe efficiency plays an important role in approaching to teamwork. In order to bring up the efficiency, one would need to be aware of one’s capabilities and the capabilities of the team. Then, it is vital to dissect all the aspect of project/task. Therefore, by knowing one’s own ability and the teammates’, the team can separate the task efficiently as possible by allocating different task to appropriate team members, enabling every individuals in the team to perform best on their strength. 
 Communication then seems to come next. Being able to communicate clearly about what I accomplished throughout the project to the team is vital. Although each individuals may work separately on different tasks for efficiency, usually those separate works will need to come together to reach the goal of the project. Being able to explain individual’s working process articulately to the teammate will help combine the works together.  I also believe It is also important to encourage every teammates to communicate about any unexpected circumstances as soon as possible. Those unexpected situations may affect the tasks of other teammates which may delay the working progress. Faster and clearer the teammates communicate about the problems, faster adjustments could be made within the team. 
",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"I've recently noticed that cannabis industry has started to gain more notice due to different country allowing recreational use of cannabis. I believe that cannabis becoming legal for recreational use can open up a new area of research for data scientist to explore.This project therefore significantly interested me since I always wanted to apply data science skill in a new area that were not often been discussed. ""Pricing norms in cannabis markets"" project stood out to me the most among all other projects since it was the only project that I personally had curiosity about. I sometimes questioned what strategy do different cannabis companies make to in order to compete in the cannabis market. Does specific type of words such as relaxation, creativity, and euphoria in product description affect customer behavior? Does the users of different amount of THC in cannabis bud show relationship with other products? How do companies adjust the price of cannabis product to both satisfy the customer and increase profit? These were only some of the questions that I was interested in, and it is fascinating that I could gain an opportunity to explore similar types of questions using data analytic skills. ",Kiwibot delivery robots,"Clinients of Kiwibot seems to be increasing just by counting the time I encountered the Kiwibot while being around Berkeley. Since more and more people are using the Kiwibot, improving customer services should be important in order to maintain and increase user experiences. I believe that customers will most of the time be satisfied if a cute Kiwibot delivers their deal in front of their door. I wonder if there actually is a estimated delivery time that clients of Kiwibot are most likely to be satisfied. Does the calculated estimated delivery time specifically apply for customers of Kiwibot or is the estimated time general for all other meal delivery service customers to be satisfied with. These were some question I had while looking up for the project, and I am eager to find out if I gain an opportunity to participate in this project. I always wanted to participate in a data driven project where my work will contribute in enhancing the customer-product relationship, and this was the only project that i was able to find among all other project that satisfied that my criteria.

Collecting and analyzing data fascinates me; therefore, pursuing a future in statistics has been branded in my mind.
	At Laney College, after obtaining one of the highest grades in the class, my statistics professor recommended me to read Significance magazines, so I can learn more about how statistics is applied in real-life situations. I started reading articles from Significance daily to help develop a better understanding. Because of this habit, I noticed the methods I use to collect and analyze data based on different situations became more systematic. Other than theories, I want to focus on practices, so when I go back to my parents’ store, I can use confidence intervals to measure the percentages of whether the regulars will still buy the products if prices rise and hypothesis testing to decide whether my parents should adopt a new business strategy.

And it was through this love of building where I was introduced to LEGO robotics where I wrote my own programs to make a robot follow a line or stop before a wall. Even the most basic programs sparked an interest in me, which made me decide to pursue computer science as an academic interest. On my high school robotics team, I spent countless hours in my teammate’s garage writing complex programs to correct robot movement error and used computer vision to detect different patterns on the field. However, at the time, I hadn’t carefully thought about how my tech could impact the communities around me. When I came to Berkeley, I joined an Asian-Pacific Islander (API) Recruitment and Retention Center where I learned more about my political identity through learning API history and contemporary issues, and I became a science and engineering mentor for underserved youth in Berkeley/Oakland where I met various students from multiple different backgrounds. I have recognized that there are many disparities and dilemmas within our communities in education, socioeconomic status, and more.

From environmental justice to digital humanities to flight behavior, I am excited to see what kind of applications I can utilize my data science skills in. I really want to gain the experience of using what I’ve learned in class and apply it to practical problems in the real world. Along with improving my technical skills, I wish to hone my communication and teamwork skills as well, collaborating with graduate students, professors, or other experts in the subject, so I can learn from their experiences and work ethic. I want to create new memories with a whole community of people who are passionate about utilizing technology to make a positive social impact through overcoming data challenges to analyze critical issues.","My approach to teamwork is to communicate frequently and clearly, while also supporting and trusting others on my team. Effective communication lets team members understand what task to complete next, allows members to know what each of their roles are, and prevents repetitive work. Communication also lets team members provide constructive feedback and also express multiple thoughts and ideas on how to approach different problems which helps improve the project that they are developing by providing meaningful intellectual discussion. Good teamwork also means creating trust between team members because micromanaging or having one person do all the work because they don’t trust others goes against the concept of collaboration. To put these into example, Last summer, I was presented with a problem of creating an analytics/operations dashboard from scratch, so I needed to think of a real-time, interactive, and user-friendly design. In order to make my design more effective and relevant to all employees, I worked collaboratively with my supervisor and the operations team throughout the development and deployment cycle to gain their feedback. Because I communicated frequently with my supervisor and my peers and also gained their trust, my dashboard ended up being a huge success and several employees expressed satisfaction with the ease of use. ",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"I am interested in Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data because I want to learn more about machine learning in the context of visual data. Having done a research project in high school about multidrug resistance, I have worked with visual data. More specifically, I analyzed the molecular structure of the binding site in a protein ligand in a software environment. The project was focused on getting rid of multidrug resistance, the phenomenon by which cells stop responding to treatment, usually due to efflux of the drug. To combat this, we used anthocyanins, a class of naturally-occurring compounds found in many berries, to competitively inhibit the human Multidrug-Resistance Proteins and allow chemotherapy drugs to act on the cell and ultimately combat cancer. Using machine learning on visual data in order to predict properties of molecules in medical-related contexts would be really helpful because it would be beneficial to research projects similar to mine in the past and also more advanced medical research that professionals are working on in the present day. ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"I am interested in streaming data analysis because last semester in CS 170, I learned about multiple streaming algorithms that are used in order to process streams. I thought the subject was really intriguing because it demonstrated ways to process data items in real-time which is so crucial in today’s world where people track changes in the stock market in real-time, where sensors in vehicles constantly monitor its performance for safety, where more and more data is being posted on the internet every second. I would love to learn more in depth about processing streaming data, and in this case, applying prediction and machine learning techniques to the data in order to get more insight. Being able to predict streaming data would be really beneficial for public safety if a transit vehicle is not working properly and also for entertainment streaming services including music, movies, and games which affects everyone across the globe. I hope I can contribute to this project and improve streaming technology and ultimately improve our world.",,,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,I heard about the Discovery Program through a friend.,Nope!

I was born and raised here in the Bay Area with a twin brother and a younger sister and have lived here my whole life. One interesting fact about my birth was that I was born 10 weeks premature along with my twin brother, weighing around 3 pounds and some ounces. I was incapable of basic functions such as crying, eating, or drinking. Fortunately, we have both turned out fine with the help of medical technology and the support of our parents (we may not have been so lucky without such technology). My parents are both immigrants of Chinese descent: my father is from Mauritius and my mother is from Indonesia. It is from these cultures that I have my roots. 

Growing up, I wanted to be many things: a teacher, a scientist, an astronaut, and, more recently, a leading computer and data scientist. My goal in life is to create or work at something that touches upon some or all these areas and consequently, contribute to the improvement of the lives of others. Within computer science, my interests are far ranging, but I am particularly interested in the Internet and security. I also enjoy algorithms. Being able to think about problems that have unique challenges and require thinking outside the box interest me the most. Outside of computer science, I am interested in the mind, having taken COGSCI 1 AND PSYCH 110. I enjoy learning about how we think and would like to explore this area as well.

At UC Berkeley, I have also pursued teaching and served as a UGSI for CS 61A this past semester. This past summer, I also worked with a group of UC Berkeley students on an educational game related to climate change. This involved database design and web development. 

 A few fun facts about me are that in the summer of my junior year in high school I attended the National Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders where I was able to shake hands with 2012 Physics Nobel Prize winner Dr. David J. Wineland and be audience to an interview with astronaut Buzz Aldrin himself. Outside of the academic realm, I like to watch films, draw, and hang out with friends. I also have 1 dog, 3 birds, and several fish.","I wish to gain 3 things: knowledge, experience, and community. I want to learn more about concepts related to data science and computer science. I want the opportunity to create and work hands-on on projects that have real-life implications. Lastly, I want to make new friends who are interested in the same things I am interested in and who are passionate about learning and creating something new.","I treat others how I would like to be treated and I value the opinions, ideas, and contributions of all team members. This goes without saying. As for how I function within a team, I approach teamwork actively. What this means is that I am open to voicing my ideas when appropriate and giving feedback if necessary. If I sense a group member may not be contributing as much work into the project, I would make suggestions and ask them to join in the conversation. Also, if I sense there is an issue that needs to be addressed, I first consult with the team before addressing it, so that I can take into consideration the opinions of all. As an example, when I first started working on ClimatEG with a team of Berkeley students, there was an inconsistency between what our supervisor told us and what he actually did. Before raising this issue up with our supervisor, I wanted to confirm with the team if this was an issue and what their thoughts were about it. After confirming the issue, I addressed our supervisor about it, and after he responded, I again made sure that all of my teammates agreed with the final outcome.
",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"The topic of this project is one that I am personally deeply interested in, as a woman in STEM. It is also personal because my mother attended UC Berkeley and majored in Computer Science, just as I am now. The persistence of women in STEM over time is something I would like to explore. Since the time my mother attended college, the participation of women in tech has definitely changed (increased in most cases), but the the case still remains of women reporting that the majority of the students in their STEM courses are male and that women are still largely underrepresented. My mother, who has been in the industry for many years, has even told me that often times she is the only female present in the room.

In researching ways to visualize these trends, I would also like to know what sort of conclusions can be derived from them. This project is crucial in this respect, because it allows us to take a step forward into thinking about how we can possibly change the state of women in tech for the better.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"I am interested in the unique approach of this project: rather than focusing on building hate speech detection algorithms the project takes a niche approach and explores algorithms for inclusion and belonging. This project also has its obvious positive social impacts. Online hate speech is a major issue that has arisen with the rise of social media and solutions like these are needed. Also, this project would involve creative thinking as to how to design the algorithm and what kind of metrics are needed. I would like to explore this.",Community Air Monitoring Monthly Report,I am interested in this project for its positive social impact.

This was the first time I had worked on a semester-long project, and I had never had such an open-ended project before. My teammates and I brainstormed what visualizations to make and used our skills with Python, Pandas, and Tableau in order to accomplish our goals. Through participating in Discovery Research I want to advance my skills and learn how to use them to accomplish a goal in research.","When it comes to teamwork, I always want to be open-minded and willing to compromise. While I develop ideas and opinions on my own, group discussion and consideration for others are what I value most. I also think that with teamwork there should be a balance of brainstorming and discussing ideas together and dividing up work in order to do it more efficiently.",Innovation Resources Database,"While I have been fortunate to have a stable and safe housing situation, I know that many others my age experience homelessness.

For example, in addition to majoring in Data Science, I am also minoring in Asian American Studies because I personally think that it is essential to not only be technically literate, but also ethically well versed as well.  My dream job would be helping vulnerable communities take back their agency in the form of an equitable inclusive technical solution.  One of my favorite classes that I’ve taken here at Cal is the Human Contexts and Ethics of Data because it opened my eyes to realize how biases can affect seemingly objective things like data.  I think understanding both the technical skills of data science along with its implications are the most essential components of what it means to be a a data scientist.  In terms of organizational involvement at Cal, I’m a project manager in Codeology (CS Club), a paddler for Cal Dragon Boat, a data scientist for DataStory (DS Club), and a member of the Society Women Engineers chapter at UC Berkeley.","As a junior with more clearly defined aspirations of my career path, I want to be able to apply the skills that I’ve learned in the classroom to create action for my community.  I want to work on a long term project that has real world implications and something that I can translate into an interest to a specific field that I want to continue to explore in especially for the potential of attending graduate school.  Throughout my time at Cal, I’ve been lucky to gain exposure to a wide variety of different subjects, but I want to be able to dive deeper to gain more expert knowledge as opposed to continuing to expand horizontally.

Additionally, I am hoping to gain a mentor through this program who is directly working in a role and field that I am interested in.  I have great mentors in my life, but I am lacking guidance specifically in growing professionally as a data scientist.  I hope to develop a relationship where I can find a mentor that I can bounce ideas and questions in relation to my career and interests in the field of data science.","I’ve been lucky enough to work in both technical and non technical environments in a team.  For non technical, I am currently a paddler on Cal Dragon Boat and it’s been an amazing experience to go from knowing nothing about the sport to being on our fastest competitive boat.  Being on the team has not only taught me discipline in sticking to a training regiment, but it has also shown me the value of community and developing a relationship with my fellow paddlers.  It doesn’t matter if one person is significantly stronger because to succeed as a team, 20 people must move together to make the boat move.  This has been my philosophy in approaching teamwork and it’s one that I try to implement as a product manager in Codeology and a data scientist in DataStory.  We have to play to the strengths of one another and learn how to construct a plan that everyone is passionate and excited about.  Great teams are amazing because each person has a shared understanding with a culture of uplifting, inclusivity, and empowerment.  When there is a shared vision and open lines of communication, the team go can faster and accomplish more than just one person moving alone.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"As an Data Science major and Asian American Studies minor, it is important to me to not only be technically capable, but socially literate as well.  This project fits directly with my passions of using data for social good.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of research and development on the rules and standard of cyberspace.  This detector would be a pivotal project in shaping global norms and provide a structured strategic approach on how to engage with cases of divisive language.  Especially with current concern about the use of online exposure in child development like, for example, in social media, this project can provide another angle in examining interactions of online speech.  Finally, the scope of this detector is truly remarkable because the entire world is affected by this issue as the internet has become an integral part of everyday life.  Such an algorithm has the power to do so much good, but yet have an incredible ability to inflict harm.  I hope to be on such a project to learn and develop such guidelines and to create an algorithm that is equitable and applicable in all fields, politics, online forums, social media, new sites, advertisements, etc.",Data for Social Good,"As an Data Science major and Asian American Studies minor, it is important to me to not only be technically capable, but socially literate as well.  Data Science is so powerful because it has the ability to decipher the question of “why.”  I want to be involved in projects that have social impact and use data for good.  This project is interesting because it speaks to the core of one of the major flaws in our voting system in America.  As an Asian American Studies minor, I’ve been able to learn about the harm behind the lack of disaggregated data and the obstacles that communities of color have to face in order to assert their basic right to vote.  Barriers such an language and accessibility should not stop these communities from having a voice to speak about issues they care about.  Growing up in a community in San Francisco where the largely immigrant population was not informed about many issues and did not receive aid in helping them understand their right, I identify with the mission of serving these vulnerable communities.  The focus on low propensity voters strikes at the heart of my community and I want to make sure they have a voice not only in this upcoming election, but all future elections.",Data visualization of state of women in tech,"Leveling the gender inequity in technology is a cause that is close to my heart.  As someone who aspires to become a data scientist and work in such a field, I hope and work towards a better future where the gender wage gap doesn’t exist, and where I, as a POC woman, feel valued and confident conversing in a technical environment.  I’ve been a part of the Society of Women Engineers Chapter at Berkeley since freshman year as a general member and later in officer leadership roles, and its been a saving grace to have such a wonderful community to discuss strategies for success and share frustrations with.  Each time I walk into once of my CS or DS classrooms, I know that this gender imbalance exists even at the university level and it’s jarringly present in industry as well.  This project reminds me of Tracy Chou’s repository of statistics about the number of women in technical roles in tech companies.  Her work made such an impact that Google, Facebook, and Microsoft were pressured to release diversity reports and other companies began diversity initiatives as well.

I am majoring in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, a major that must be flexible with the changing technology, economy, and ___ of today.  I also apply this mindset to dance, for one will go nowhere with dance if they do not change your focus with the changing environment.  If a stage has a harder floor, you must recognize and analyze that information you receive to adapt and perform to the greatest potential. In our world with news being flooded in constantly, we must accept the change to know how to make the most positive impact we can. Catan is just a board game, yet the addicting game of changing strategy captivates me to adapt the same ideas in my everyday life, which may be the reason that I can always beat my siblings. ","With all the bad press in the media about the negative side of collecting data, I want to do something good with data analysis.  I want to learn how collecting and manipulating data can help the world and bring positive change, rather than just scaring people that Cambridge Analytica has their information. While working at NBC Universal last summer, I collected and organized data within the accounting department to facilitate the processes needed for multiple films and hundreds of people. As fascinating as this experience was, I want to learn how I can change the world through developing data.  I am so eager to learn and to help projects that impact lives.","In order for teamwork to be most effective, there must be a clear vision of the end result.  Every member must comprehend and participate in the establishment of the goal.  Personally, I thrive as the organizer of the group. Anyone who knows me, knows that I will color code everything to make everything clear and organized for everyone to understand. I know that I do not know everything and that each team member has unique skills that can help our group excel.  It is rewarding for the group for each member to highlight their strengths so each process works smoothly.  Each member must be listened to because everyone has a different perspective that can only offer more information to the project as a whole. This also leads to respect.

During high school I volunteered for a STEM summer camp for elementary and middle school students that aimed to teach topics and instill joy in mathematics and physics. I was a member of the camp staff, working with university professors and high school teachers to develop curriculum and run workshops for the students, in addition to helping with the day-to-day runnings of the camp. At Cal, after taking Data 100 I developed an immense appreciation for the course and wanted to be a part of the course staff to share my appreciation to other students, so I became an Academic Intern, which involves interacting with and assisting students during labs. However, I am most proud of my work developing the new Data 88 Economics Connector course along with a team of similarly-motivated undergrads and a professor sponsor. This course, intended to bridge the gap between under-division and upper-division economics classes with an emphasis on data science techniques, was developed over this last year and has exposed me to the entire teaching life cycle, from content-creation, to explaining topics, and writing and grading coursework.","Ever since taking Data 100 I have had a fascination with Data Science and its potential to solve complex problems where solutions through more traditional research seem to evade us. However, it was last semester while viewing the Discovery projects of that year when I saw just how powerful Data Science can be. All of the projects had impactful topics, and some in particular, such as one project that aimed to more accurately identify tumors from hospital scans, or another that focused on understanding and predicting gentrification, gave me a desire to apply the skills learned in school towards these and similar projects that strive to solve the problems facing society today. I feel that there is so much I can simultaneously contribute to and learn from with respect to research in Data Science, and I am hoping that the Discovery Program can be a productive opportunity for me to start making my own contributions to research and a learning opportunity for me to be able to grow and continue working in this field as a career. No other research has made me as excited as the work I saw last semester being done by undergraduates, and I hope I can be a part of one of these wonderful projects as well.","I think teams work most effectively when members of the team are all comfortable with each other, to a degree where discussion and debate can happen freely, sincerely, and passionately without fear of judgement from one's peers, while also remaining respectful of the opinions and perspectives of others. A team member should always feel able to share thoughts and concerns with the group, and my approach when joining a new team is always to reach this point of familiarity as soon as possible. In my experiences working on teams, and in particular in my work developing a Data 88 class with a group of undergraduates, I have found that a positive feedback loop forms, where increased integration within a team leads to smoother and more efficient productivity, which in turn leads to further integration and a sense of belonging through common struggles and experiences. Additionally, in order to achieve a workspace where everyone can feel comfortable and have a sense of purpose, I am always mindful of the perspectives of others and respectful of their opinions. A successful team listens to all points of view and carefully considers the best options through rigorous research and debate, and this requires a mutual respect among group members and a willingness to have an open ear and open mind at all times.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I first developed a strong interest in research in data science from looking at the Discovery projects from last year, and in particular a project involving the use of machine learning algorithms to identify breast cancer tumors from hospital scans caught my attention and motivation for doing research in data science.

Heart disease is a glaring threat to public health, and one that my grandfather suffered from along with millions of other people. A meaningful development in this field would result in a considerable improvement in the quality of life of people around the world, which I think is a noble goal to strive for and one that I would love to be able apply my DS skills to make a contribution to in any way.

Having these experiences, the factors that determine student success have always been something interesting to me that I enjoy thinking about, especially given that particularly successful students come from a diverse range of backgrounds, and students from similar groups and backgrounds can seemingly have different learning outcomes. In my experience the question of what leads to student success and how can we encourage more success is an extremely challenging one, and one that I think is worthwhile studying given that no definitive answers are agreed upon by all.

These internships have allowed me to develop my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills, while also giving me a foundational understanding of how the corporate world functions. I’ve realized that in a professional setting, I’m expected to provide value to the firm I work for, in contrast to only being responsible for learning in an academic setting. 

My major concentration in Quantitative Social Science allowed me to explore my interest in Sociology and Demography, as I’m interested in both how humans have evolved and how they expect to evolve in the future. 

Personally, I enjoy volunteering. In past semesters, I’ve volunteered through Rotaract and at the Food Pantry. I was also involved in a cultural club, where I volunteered at free medical clinics held at Sikh temples. Because of my immersion in the real world and theoretical education at Berkeley, I believe I’m well-prepared to handle the challenges of life post-graduation. 
","Through Discovery Research, I hope to attain the technical skills necessary to be an effective Data Scientist post-graduation. While my classes have certainly given me foundational skills in Programming and Statistics, I believe that I need to apply this knowledge to new problems, in contrast to problems that have already been solved. 

I wish to gain insight on which data science techniques would be most applicable to certain types of research problems. I’d also like to learn from professional researchers on how a problem can be efficiently solved utilizing both the Data Science lifecycle and scientific method. Additionally, I hope to further explore my interests in Sociology and volunteerism, by analyzing data and contributing to the research that results in public good. 

I’m keen to explore the application of Data Science on educational inequity and practices in America.

I believe that the larger task of a research project should be sub-divided into smaller tasks that play to the strengths of each team member involved. I’m confident that each research team assembled through the Discovery Research Scholars program will consist of individuals with complementary strengths. 

Consistent team meetings and documented expectations are vital for a team research project to produce a tangible, value-additive result.

When I was younger, I played soccer competitively, competing in tournaments both locally and abroad. In school, my interests swung between the structure and organisation of maths and the creativity and freedom accessible through writing. Entering high school, I began to narrow down what I spent my time on; I transitioned away from competitive soccer to spend more time on STEM related classes. Nonetheless, I also explored unfamiliar experiences outside of school. For six months, I volunteered to work for the 24 Hour Race, a nonprofit charity that organizes events in cities such as Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to raise money to fund efforts to eradicate slavery. I worked with high school students to contact potential sponsors, both corporate and individual. I’m currently looking to explore alternative avenues of research and exploration, where I can combine my eagerness for creativity and freedom with my skills in computer and data science. ","This is my first time applying to Discovery Research, where I hope to actively engage and learn more about research. The unfamiliarity I have with the field fuels my intrigue and eagerness to spend time and effort in whatever project I am fortunate enough to be selected to help out with. Furthermore, I believe this is an excellent introduction where I can utilize my developing knowledge in programming, data science techniques and deep learning algorithms to contribute to projects with real-life application. The courses and clubs I take part in on campus provide an excellent source of teaching and practice for new skills. I cannot, however, utilise my knowledge outside of the University through these means. While my skills are definitely still developing and in all likelihood not adequate to match the rigors of academic research, I am optimistic that I can be an eager and hardworking candidate for whatever position I could be selected for. Additionally, I selected a variety of data science projects in my preferences, some of which have subject material that matches my current skill set, and some of which are in fields that I can explore with a blank slate. ","Starting from when I played soccer competitively in Hong Kong, I have extensive experience working in teams. Both in a highly academic school and in an extremely talented soccer team, I was not always the most talented member in the groups I collaborated in. Through these experiences, I understand how to work together with different groups of people to succeed as a team. One of the most important values that I learned was loyalty, specifically the pledge I make with collaborators to complete my work at the highest standard possible to ensure that I do my part to make the team successful. In my first semester at Berkeley, I joined the staff of an ASUC Senator (Evina Wang), where I collaborated with an Asian coalition of students to improve the campus experience for UC Berkeley students - this included improved street lighting and collaboration with existing university and city council members responsible for this goal. While I did not extensive experience in student government, nor did I know any of the other staff I collaborated with prior to applying, I still joined this office because I believed I could be a valuable member to the team. By being diligent and hardworking, I ensured I not only did my own work to the best of my ability, but also helped and worked with others on their own goals. ",Computational Analysis of Charter School Identities and Stratification,"In high school, I collaborated with local (charter) schools in Hong Kong, where I helped coach sports to young primary students. These schools did not have the funding to support their own sports programs, and knowing how important sports can be to personal development from experience, I found this experience particularly meaningful. Now, I would like to apply my programming skills to further understand American charter schools. I have a very brief background with the conditions and student bodies of American charter schools, through discussing the topic with my brother, who volunteered to teach at charter schools in New Jersey as an undergraduate student for several semesters. I also believe my skills in Python - I took CS 61A - would be applicable and useful to this project. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"This is a project that I have significantly less background knowledge. Nonetheless, I am invigorated by the prospect of exploring and learning more about the field of medicine. I have a close friend that is currently training to become a doctor and just from talking to her, I am fascinated by its complexities. The medical and social importance of this project is also obvious, making it an extremely attractive project for me individually. ",The Docket of the Supreme Court of the United States: How does the Supreme Court decide what cases to take?,"After taking Polsci 1 (Introduction to American Politics) last semester, I now have significantly more background knowledge and interest in American politics, and in this case, the judicial system and the Supreme Court. The aim of this project raises an intriguing question, one which I would like to help explore using my programming skills and knowledge from classes last semester. In fact, while studying for PS1 last semester, I remember spending time thinking about why the selection of cases and how they are dealt with by the Supreme Court (a selection of less than a dozen individuals) can have such a profound and significant impact on American society. Specifically, before the 2002 Supreme Court case: United States v Emerson, the wording of the second amendment did not actually defend an individual's right to have a gun. But after this one Supreme Court case, this changed - 
not only resulting in over a decade's worth of argument and discussion about gun regulation but also potentially leading to multiple tragic shootings. Hence, I believe that I can be a useful member to the group working on this project, due to my interest in the subject matter and skills in programming.

I have a twin sister who attends UC Davis pursuing a degree in Mathematical Analytics and Operations Research. Since high school, I’ve enjoyed working with numbers even as it got more challenging. Aside from Data Science, I got interested in computer science after I took cs10. CS10 taught me the basic ideas of programming. I decided to take more computer science classes because it brought me excitement knowing I can create something. It’s exciting when you’ve been working on a project and you see the end product work successfully. It’s an amazing feeling even after the pain and long hours of debugging. I implemented many coding projects such as Saduko, Pac Man, Plants vs Zombies and they were all difficult to start at first. However, once you fully understand it conceptually and begin coding, it gets easier. I joined the cs scholars program and continued taking cs courses and math classes at the same time. I also enjoy the math classes I’ve taken here at Berkeley; I plan to take Math 53 this semester. I enjoy learning about math and the new perspectives it offers, viewing math as a tool to use in the real world. ","I hope to gain a better understanding of what I’m really interested in. I came into college hoping to declare math because I love working with numbers but I wasn’t sure what career to pursue with a math degree. I’ve spoken to many students majoring in applied math and/or data science and they have all given me useful feedback that have helped me into figuring out what path to take. However, after I took cs10 and cs61a, I found computer science interesting and wanted to learn more about it, so I thought I’d major in computer science. Because of my interest in both math and coding,  I began researching data science since it includes a little of both subjects that I found interesting. Looking through the past projects and meeting with someone who is also in the Data Science Society and hearing about what they’re doing now, got me intrigued in learning more about this field and the projects that can be done. I hope to meet other students and learn about their academic stories related to data science. I hope that through this program, I can develop better communication skills, professionalism and network with employers. I hope that by working on these projects will give me a better idea of what data science is and whether I’m truly interested in the field.","When I work in groups, I’m never scared to ask questions. When I don’t understand something or need clarification, I ask my questions because I know others might have the same ones and one thing I’ve learned being in Cal, is to take advantage of all the resources provided. I enjoy working in groups more so independently because I get to learn about different peoples’ approach on a project whether it be on the layout, organization or handling of the project. It's helpful for me because its taught me different ways of solving or approaching a problem. I find it beneficial being able to share my ideas and receive feedback for improvement. If we have opposing ideas on a certain way of doing something, I learn their way of thinking and either try implementing their ideas on mine or vice versa. When I work alongside someone, I try to learn more about them aside from the project. I think that’s key in working well as a group. You learn what people are capable of and place them somewhere where they can improve their skills, not necessarily what they are best at; there wouldn't be improvement or learning otherwise.

Most of my classmates, teachers, and friends did not have much interest in the rapidly developing tech industry, viewing it as “above their paygrade.” Despite my lack of exposure to tech, I was drawn to this industry and viewed it as a means of developing modern solutions in any domain, from health care to education; the potential was limitless. By the time I was in high school, I had decided that I wanted to contribute to the advancement of technology in some capacity. Fortunately, I grew up in an incredibly encouraging community. From devoted parents to inspiring teachers, they all encouraged me to shoot for goals that few people in the area achieved. I had an invaluable support system that pushed me to achieve my goals. Additionally, due to the lack of computer science education at my school, I learned to value and appreciate every opportunity I’ve been given, such as studying at Cal. Initially, I was overwhelmed by class rigor and often felt inferior to my peers. I chose to push these thoughts aside and instead seize the opportunities I’ve been given.","Research is one of the most important mechanisms that allow new and innovative discoveries to be made. Through Discovery Research, I would not only be able to contribute to this effort, but also gain more experience in a research setting. Research is one of my potential career interests and having an on the job experience would allow me to better assess my career goals. Additionally, I would be able to utilize the knowledge I have gained so far in a very practical, useful setting. Although I have much more to learn, this seems like a perfect chance to put my skills to the test. I will likely be presented with many new technologies and concepts as well, allowing me to learn new skills and hopefully grow with my teammates as the semester and project progresses.","I am currently the Vice President of Education for a data science organization at Cal. Last semester was the pilot semester of our education program in which we teach an introductory data science class for high school students. I was working with the executive board to develop the curriculum for this program. We eventually had a major disagreement as to the scope of our curriculum. Many officers wanted the curriculum to focus on developing technical skills, while I wanted it to be a topical survey course of the many aspects of data science. During a meeting, I voiced this perspective and reasoned with everyone that since the students are beginners, it is more important to foster lasting interest in data science rather than getting bogged down in intricate methodologies. This argument did not seem to convince everyone. I did not want to move ahead without gaining more support for my perspective, so I created a sample lesson based on my vision for the curriculum. I presented this lesson at our next meeting and people became more comfortable with my plan. Since I had confidence in my idea, I took the initiative to present it in a better light, rather than getting stuck in an unproductive debate.

",I believe teamwork is more efficient than working alone to answer large questions about the world such as those discussed by data scientists. Teamwork allows for different perspectives to be considered in approaching an answer. I think my approach to teamwork is based on communication and collaboration. It is vital for teammates to feel comfortable in their space and have a voice in decision making. Large projects are a collaborative process where it is better to hear from other experts experiences and opinions than jumping to one’s own conclusions. Teamwork also allows for one to become more confident in their work because one has to explain their reasoning to other teammates and creating something through collaboration allows for a stronger argument in answering a large question. ,Environmental Health Estimator,"I am intrigued by genetics and finding patterns in how our biology impacts who we are.

As I grew up, I observed the economic and political injustices that such developing economies face. From hyperinflation in Zimbabwe to demonetization in India, I witnessed the importance of good policy-making and economics in today’s world.

Both the places I consider home suffer from grave economic and political instability. This pushed me towards studying economics in order to better understand developing nations. In the midst of my quest to understand development economics better, I stumbled upon the field of data science. 

As a research intern at Center for Civil Society, a public policy thinktank in New Delhi, I utilized various data science libraries and web-scraping methods to gather and analyze data for my research paper on the Labor Inspectorate in New Delhi.  The fusion of both my passions together led to a huge success. My paper got published and was also recognized by the Indian National Congress. From that day onwards, I realized how data science can be used to answer the world’s dilemmas. I hope to learn more data science methods in order to continue my quest to understand development economics.
","As I partake in the Discovery Research, I hope to learn more about the scope of Data Science in today’s world. Discovery Research provides me with a platform to learn more about data science methods in a research setting. As mentioned previously, I believe data science and machine learning methods have revolutionized research in all academic fields. As an extremely passionate economics student, I believe data science can be used to solve modern economics dilemmas as faced by developing nations.

Many of the projects provided in the Discovery Research program provide me with the exact opportunity of utilizing my data science skills to learn about economic, social and political phenomenon. I believe that the opportunity to work with professors and graduate students will give me the right exposure to learn more about how academics use data science methods to make positive impact on society.
","In Fall 2019, I acted as the Editor-In-Chief of the Berkeley Economic Review, Berkeley’s premier undergraduate economics journal. I led a team of 70 members and 7 department heads to ensure the publication of our magazine and journal. As part of this organization, I greatly revised my approach towards teamwork.

As it was my first time leading a campus organization, I struggled with managing all 7 departments simultaneously while being able to complete my own tasks. I realized my mistake. I was trying to micro-manage a large organization. Thus, I realized that one of the most important aspects of working in a team is dividing tasks equally and maintaining an atmosphere of open communication and comfort.

My approach to teamwork consists of setting realistic expectations beforehand and having faith in other team-members to be able to complete their tasks in a timely manner. In case of any kind of conflicts, it is important to foster a sense of comradery and open communication so that a team doesn’t fall apart. I have noticed that people work the best if they feel included and content being part of the team. This approach to team work succeeded as the Berkeley Economic Review website received a record number of page hits during Fall 2019 and we successfully published our magazine and journal.

My devotion to environmental protection is deep-rooted because of these experiences and exposure to Earth, and my goal in attending UC Berkeley has remained to become a voice and significant contributor to this field of work. In high school, through my dedication to student government and the privilege of having an exceptional US History teacher, I discovered my passion for government and that I wished to apply it to my mission of contributing to environmental progress. In college – amidst challenges such as homesickness, my first real heartbreak, and trying to heal my ever-so persistent runner's knee I had developed from participating in my high school's cross country program– I realized my interest and natural affinity for math was stronger than I had assumed. This led me to combine math with my passion for government, and major in environment economics. During college I also discovered that I wished to concentrate on water resources in the environmental field, and I adopted a second major of Conservation and Resource Studies in order to take more water specific courses. My appreciation for data science and its applications to my majors has subsequently evolved.","Data science is our generation's new tool for solving the world's problems. I am deeply inspired and motivated by the change and progress data science has made so far, and I am eager to be a participating member in this revolution. I truly enjoyed taking Data 8, and I have seen how applicable data science is to my area of study, the research I have been a part of on campus, and the internships I have applied to. I listened to an interview in which an ecology professor (who is now also an expert in machine learning in order to apply it to his research) stated that the only thing progressing at the same rate as environmental destruction is machine learning. Data science offers new hope to this monumental challenge. The environmental projects of the Discovery Research program present me with the next thrilling challenge in my life's work. In addition, I hope to improve my data science skills, expand my overall experience and familiarity with participating in a research project, and contribute to a project that will improve the lives of people and our planet. ","Longstanding progress cannot be achieved without some degree of teamwork. Every individual has immense capability and unique skills that can lead to achievement. When teamwork is nourished and required, each aspect of the project at hand can be delegated to a different person(s) who possess the matching skill, and therefore the project can be accomplished more thoroughly and successfully. Teamwork gives creativity a birthplace. I have been involved in activities and extra curricular's from a young age that showed me the value of working in a team, and the significance of what can be achieved when everyone's strengths are acknowledged and their room for improvement is encouraged. I highly value other's feedback, and I approach situations of working with others as an opportunity to learn. I recognize and bring forward my strengths and talents, and I consistently give my full effort toward the goal my team and I are tackling.

During my internship at Palo Alto Medical Foundation, my curiosity about a study of genetic testing for Type I diabetic patients led to my first exposure of bioengineering. Five semesters later, I have decided to pursue the data science and bioengineering. In particular, I am interested in how to build better real time diagnostics that not just impact health, but the way we work and community as a whole. As part of Society of Women Engineers Team Tech, I had the opportunity to work on such a project – constructing an emergency health app for construction workers from data about portable light and electricity usage. I learned that there is so much potential for the intersection of bioengineering and data science and all I needed to do was roll up my sleeves and get working in all the different aspects.  
Outside of academics, I play violin and sing semi-professionally in an improvisational musical genre called Hindustani Classical. This is my source of bliss, introspection, and medium to express myself. 
On campus, I love being a Residential Assistant. It has helped me hone communication skills and keep a presence of mind during crisis. For instance, I have had to address many questions from the paramedics and the resident in a medical emergency. It was critical for me to not be overwhelmed, but instead calm and alert so that I could provide the right resources and information immediately. 
Other than that, I love learning and pushing myself in new ways. The past semester, I went to my first professional conference and joined an intramural soccer team. 
","What I found so fascinating about the Discovery Research program was the opportunity, as a bioengineer, to help solve the world’s biggest health problems through the power of good data, proper interpretation, and practical application. The program focuses on bringing a diverse set of viewpoints to data science, which I want to immerse myself in. While I believe that data presents a unique opportunity to improve overall care and health outcomes, I also need to practice the nuances of when and where the best practices of data science can occur. Through interaction with scientists and fellow researchers, I hope to gain this perspective. In addition, hands on research will help me develop the necessary skills to drive a sustainable, positive change through data science. ","Being engaged, listening intently, and actively participating is how I approach teamwork. As a residential assistant, I have the opportunity to work in teams of 30 or more fellow residential assistants and communicating openly is extremely important. I realize that every RA has a reason why they are in the role and that brings their unique perspective to the benefit of our team, so having meaningful conversations helps me create positive change and memorable programs. Another important part of teamwork can be conflict resolution. In my experience as subgroup director of a world music club, Laya of Berkeley, I managed a conflict while creating an original group composition. I learned that having one on one conversations and understanding the root cause of the issue was the best way to solve conflicts. Therefore, I made time for planning, gave each member time to study, reflect, and contribute. This allowed my teammates to gain valuable insights from each other and contribute a new way of looking at our piece.
",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"My passion as a bioengineer is to build real time diagnostics and this project perfectly provides the opportunity for an end to end solution where data can be integrated into helping save patients. Specifically, this project not only works on natural language processing, a skill I wish to practice, but has a goal to deliver a packaged information so that physicians and communities are enabled. It would be a privilege to work with and understand the needs of different communities in regard to bladder cancer. My experience as a residential assistant has taught me the differences in health experiences among minority groups first-hand, and the fact that this project is quantifying this issue, motivates me. ",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,"Through seminars and my previous internship at a medical startup, I recognize that drug efficacy and practical prescription are two sides of the coin. Looking, researching, and analyzing the data from this perspective really excites me. This project’s work can be a trend setter in the life cycle of a new drug discovery. In addition, finding optimal solutions to Crohn’s disease is a personal motivation since my uncle struggles with disease and continues to try different treatments. Being a part of this project, will give me the opportunity to not only develop my data analytical skills, but help to greatly reduce the time necessary for the dissemination of medicines that can most benefit patients like my uncle. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data is of pivotal importance to me because through my readings, I have realized that cardiac disease in children in Asian communities are common and significant. Combining data from several different devices can enable earlier detection and treatment, specifically for children, as time is a critical factor. As a bioengineer looking for exposure between data science and real time diagnostics, this project presents the perfect opportunity to learn the technical skills needed to bridge my two core academic concentrations – medical devices and data science.

With the background of a transfer student, I have often felt as though I need to play catch up to avoid being ""left out"" of opportunities that seem more viable for my non-transfer peers.

However, I have applied myself continuously to find the intersection of my own interests, abilities, and drive in order to take advantage of opportunities unique to Cal whenever possible. For example, in the last semester I designed a sticker which was selected to represent Haas, I participated in a human-centered design project which serves to enhance communication between housemates, and I proposed solutions on a team to Wells Fargo's advertising company which were used in their recent Holiday Drive Promotion.

Furthermore, I am passionate about skincare as a means of self-care, having compassion for others, and pursuing your goals in the face of hardship.","I am always looking to see how my impact can be bigger than myself. Ever since community college--when my professor passed away and I had suddenly lost a great mentor--when I stood by my mom as she overcame breast cancer--when I grew relationships with individuals of extremely varied backgrounds, many of whom lived in or close to poverty--my perspective has shifted meaningfully. Life is in so many ways unfair and unforgiving, yet all the while precious, that I feel the greatest use of my time is applying my current skill set and skills I gain toward causes that can save and improve lives of undeserved communities. I believe participating in Discovery Research would allow me to engage in this practice looking through a new lens, all while empowering me, as a transfer student in my last semester, to be relentless in my pursuit of knowledge and a better world.","In a team setting, I am most excited to brainstorm ideas, learn from others, and come together to hear new perspectives that can build upon one another. I strongly believe it is crucial to get diverse opinions so that we can overcome potential personal bias, as well as to be organized and divide work fairly to maintain equity and achieve efficiency on a team. ",Data Enabled Donations,"I am extremely interested in disaster response and how it can be optimized to mitigate suffering of affected parties. This project seems to be a bit open-ended at this point so I am curious to explore what data can be gathered and organized regarding donations to shelters, as well the implications for how that data can improve the efficacy of such a donation system.

Likewise, I have always been inspired by the creation of products which can make some of the difficulties in the aftermath of a disaster less burdensome, such as portable lights which make it possible to see and function a bit more normally in an area with compromised electricity. I think the idea of what type of products and donations are functional and most needed following a disaster is very relevant to this topic and something I would love to explore.",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"Young people experiencing homelessness are one of the most vulnerable populations to violence. Reading this project description is very inspiring and meaningful to me in shining a light on how such a difficult situation can be improved through identifying safe spaces and structures of safety. This study seems to have complex layers but I hope that my service could be useful to one aspect of the larger whole. I especially appreciate the applicability to policymakers, researchers, and social service providers to put the data we collect and curate into action.",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"My experience with underserved communities has made it apparent to me how environmentally unjust our world is.

My recent involvement in a project about the injustice of the Maquiladora system along the US-Mexico border has shined a light on this issue in that region, where the aggregation of low-wage factories has left communities to deal with toxic waste and violence in their communities. 

This is just what example of what is experienced in one area, but I know this issue is so large and complex that being part of aggregating data from across the nation would be meaningful to me. This work is clearly developing a highly valuable tool and represents an important step towards identifying factors which contribute to the problem and how they can be combated.

After that, I worked full-time at a startup doing market research and customer data analysis without any formal education. In Fall 2016 I came to America without the slightest idea of what I wanted to do, but with a bit of luck and lots of support from my professors at Chabot College, I discovered a passion for Statistics and what the major has to offer. To test the waters, I signed up to be a Statistics learning assistant and tutor. Over the course of 4 semesters, I learned from my peers, coworkers and professors, gained a better understanding of myself, and deepened my knowledge more than I ever thought I could. Now that I have got my foot in the door at Berkeley, it is time for me to find new opportunities and open new doors, starting at Discovery Research.","Despite my early exposure to statistics and data analytics, I feel like I still have not gotten any formal experience in this industry. It is a promising field that I would love to dedicate my time and effort to explore and learn since I believe I will learn a lot from the experience. I am also intrigued by a number of the projects being offered this semester since their goals speak to me on a personal level, and I strongly believe that these projects are poised to better people's lives, for example, the Student Success Analytics Platform can categorize and pinpoint quite accurately what students need to flourish, as well as provide their participants with a different lens on our daily problems, like what kind of process it will take to monitor your water purification system. So, being able to participate in Discovery Research not only means I get to satisfy my curiosity and grow as an individual but also is a way for me to give back to the community by helping to bring the project to life.","To me, communication is key. If my teammates and I cannot openly communicate effectively about our work and be on the same page, it can create a blind spot and slow us down over time. Being communicative also means I want to be honest and vulnerable about my strengths and weaknesses so that I can get help from my teammates in as soon as problems arise. And it is just as crucial to be collaborative and team-oriented. You can work on a project entirely on your own, but it would get much easier to share the load. I like to think of teamwork as a jigsaw puzzle and every member is a piece that needs to be placed correctly to solve the said puzzle. One person’s strengths can compensate for another’s weaknesses. Even when you’re doing what you’re good at, you can come across areas that you are not familiar with - this is when a teammate’s expertise can be helpful.",Student Success Analytics Platform,"When midterms and finals rolled around while I was working as a learning assistant in my community college when midterms and finals rolled around, I would meet with my professor to look at the students' performances throughout the semester to try and predict how they would do in their exams. This helped us determine which students most urgently needed our assistance. However, the process was done by hand, so it was fairly labor-intensive and time-consuming. With that in mind, given access to a large set of real-time data and resources, this platform could be a far more effective device to recognize and respond to the needs of students across campus. Also, this project's application is not limited to education - it can produce some great insights about success analytics to be applied to the outside world. I can imagine it being useful in the corporate world where people constantly try to understand and improve their employee's performances.",Automated Water Purification,"Coming from a developing country in Southeast Asia, tap water used to be a luxury for me. Who would have thought that drinking tap water doesn’t have to send you to the ER every time? Old habit dies hard, even now when I drink water straight out of the sink I still wonder whether it is safe or not. That personal experience is why it is important for me to be able to monitor the chemicals that come with my daily water intake, and I imagine other people also share similar concerns about theirs. Having an app to do that for us sounds delightful and exciting. Also, this is a good chance for me to learn about what kind of work needs to be done to purify the water so that I can be more conscious of my food consumption. Lastly, I think this project will be eye-opening and educational since I will get to work with other peers from other departments and learn about their work in a collaborative environment.

Starting from classical piano roots that all Chinese-American students are pushed towards, I used my experiences to combine alongside uniquely generated synthesizers and drums. I followed that passion to Berkeley and elected to double major in Economics and Data Science with a minor in music. While I can sometimes be spotted in Doe writing a melody on a digital audio workstation, I’ve fallen in love with the challenges and learning opportunities within Data Science. Since Data 8, it has always been intriguing utilizing information to design quantitative “truths” that can explain trends and explore ideas to a degree never previously reached in the history of mankind. I search for new knowledge and ways to benefit society with information that can help benefit companies and clients. Outside of these interests, I love to play badminton on the weekends, sing in the Cal Gospel choir, and try the latest food innovations in the Bay Area. 
","I wish to gain the essential experiences needed to become a better Data Scientist and independent researcher. Through trials and tribulations collaborating with other prospective Data Scientists, I want to work towards improving my comprehensive knowledge and efficiency in data analysis and problem-solving. While working alongside other passionate and like-minded individuals I will be granted the opportunity to learn alongside other curious students that put the knowledge and research first. Overall, I want to learn more about Data Science, discover more about the world around me, and push myself to reach my own personal goals. 
","Working in a team requires compromise, collective effort, and a clear vision. For each individual to work successfully on a team, internal attitudes should align with the values and vision of the project itself. When problems ultimately arise in any project, it is the responsibility of all members to address their own shortcomings before identifying how others could improve. With team members collaborating under the same positive attitude, comprehensive structure for leadership and objective feedback always helps to shed light on how individuals may be able to grow and develop their own skills. 

For me personally, I am an adaptive leader and follower that analyzes what a group needs to function at its optimal capacity. The team cannot operate with 5 leaders with their own goals and a team of followers leads to nothing. From past experiences in committees organizing concerts at Peoples’ Park or consulting projects in the Undergraduate Economics Association, effective teamwork has been ingrained as a characteristic within my everyday lifestyle. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"As a student looking to do the most social good through Data Science, I found this project to have the optimal vision for helping humans in need.

While I expect this to be a challenging project, I also find it to be the most intellectually and socially rewarding project above all others. I would really enjoy this assignment and working alongside the other students passionate about this subject.

My main academic interests are data science and mobile development. I first get interested in data science through taking data8, and gradually getting more interesting in it after joining a few data science clubs such as Data Science Society(DSS) and Statistics Undergraduate Student Association(SUSA), as well as taking ML classes through DeCal and Coursera. It is through these experiences that I gained experience in tools like TensorFlow and platforms like Kaggle. Last summer, I worked as an ML research intern in a university lab, working on 3D Computer Vision research while reading papers in the area of CV, which further interested me in the application of machine learning. 

Outside of data science, I am a sportsperson. I regularly play soccer as well as basketball. Another thing I enjoy doing is community service. During vacations, I participate in community service, coaching kids soccer, or sometimes teaching them English. I also like to work on many side projects, such as a mobile app that I am working on right now. 
","I wish to gain hands-on experience in data science research through the discovery program.

I had been interested in data science for a long time. For the past semesters, I having been involved in many data science projects, however, most of them are club related or just personal projects. I enjoy the feeling of gaining meaningful insight into a data set through exploring the features and applying different models. My summer research internship in 3D computer vision further intrigued me in doing data science-related research. I would like to continue to engage in data science research and have my own impact on a topic by applying what I have learned.","When it comes to teamwork, I also work according to two principles: communication and leading by example.

I talk to people before starting on a project, knowing what their strengths are and how available they are because oftentimes it is inevitable to deal with some team members having other commitments and limited time to devote to our project. Thus I always try to know in advance in everyone’s skillset and availability. Having done many CS and data science projects in the past, this saved me a lot of time and energy. This approach especially helped me in my CS170 project, since the project working week coincided with midterms week.

Leading by example is also very important. I learned to respect people’s own thoughts throughout the past semesters at Berkeley. Oftentimes when I want my teammates to work on certain tasks, I found the best way is to work on my own parts while frequently updating them in group chats. I found that once my teammates start to see how much work I have been putting into the project every day instead of telling them what to do, they will themselves be aware enough to start taking responsibility.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I have always been very interested in working on the medical application of machine learning. One of the main reasons why I am attracted to the application of machine learning is its ability to assist diagnosis. I have a friend who works on ML-based medical imaging in detecting brain tumors at the Berkeley Institute of Data Science. I have frequent conversations with this friend on what he has been working on, and I aspire to work on a similar project. I wanted to contribute to developments that can benefit people, and this project has a great potential impact on thousands of patients.

Another reason is that I am interested in a career in AI-driven healthcare solutions. UCSF is a renowned institution in this area, and I feel like by working in this research project I can learn much and know many people who might help me in building a potential career in this field. 

Lastly, I think my experience in CV related researches and projects prepared me for this project. I am qualified for handling tasks like echocardiograms classification.

In terms of technical ability, I have experience in NLP projects. I built a logistic-regression based classifier that helps predicts the rating the reviews of electronic products on Amazons. To do this project, I self-studied Stanford's CS224n to understand popular word embedding frameworks. Although I still have much to learn for NLP, I really want to participate in this project.",Forecasting Day Ahead Electric Load using a Machine Learning Application and Bottom-up Aggregation of Individual Meters,"I have always been very interested in working on a non-profit project that could bring about positive changes to a community. I am particularly interested in this project because of its potential impact on the East Bay Community. Moreover, I have seen similar projects that predict the usage of electricity based on historical data. I was at the time interested in those projects, and I am very excited to be engaged with a project like this.

I have worked on various past projects that involve predictions using regression techniques. For example, I worked on a data set of reviews on Amazon for electronic products. I built a logistic-regression based classifier that predicts the rating of the reviews. I have a good understanding of different regression techniques as well as the tools needed for implementation, such as sci-kit learn and pandas. I believe I am prepared to contribute to this project.

I came to college as an intended pre-law student with no technical experience, but decided to pursue computer science instead after my freshman year. After declaring, I was interested in gaining real-world business experience to complement technical knowledge so I joined Berkeley Consulting, working with major entertainment, fashion, and automobile clients across 3 semesters as both a consultant and project manager. I've also explored more technical extracurriculars, including tutoring for CS61C and Data 100 and a data-focused consulting project with the Student Association for Applied Statistics.

Outside of academics and professional experiences, my interests include house music, film, and fashion/sneakers. Some fun facts: I once backpacked across Spain over the course of 30 days, once lived at a Buddhist monastery for 2 weeks, and have made 3 short films.","There are three main things I hope to gain from the Discovery Research. First, it presents a great opportunity to work with and learn from world-class data science researchers, who are pursuing answers to some of the most interesting questions data science can answer. Also in this vein, it could connect me with like-minded data science students in a collaborative setting, where we can grow as students through working together. Second, it offers a chance to get hands-on experience with real-world data science, as opposed to the more theoretical approach to the subject often employed in coursework—this could involve working with uncleaned data, learning new libraries, or building a model without a ""right"" answer to guide you. Lastly, as someone who is considering both grad school and full-time work after graduation, the program would allow me to get a sense of what research is really like so I can make a more informed decision.","To me, the main pillars of team work are strong communication, under-promising/over-delivering, openness to feedback/differing opinions, and peer mentorship. Communication is clearly important to a successful team, yet is often underemphasized—I personally believe over-communication is the safest approach, whether it be confirming receipt/understanding of something, asking questions or clarifications about an assignment, or reaching out when in need of guidance. I also always make an effort to under-promise and over-deliver when working in teams, since failing to meet expectations can hold back the entire team's progress. Further, I try to welcome as much feedback as possible, since honest feedback is the only way you can actually grow as a member of a team. And finally, peer mentorship is incredibly important—team leaders' time is usually limited, so team members should be able to rely on one another for help.",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I personally find health-care diagnostics to be the most interesting application of data science currently being explored. Unlike data science focused on industry or data science research mostly of interest to others in academia, data science for health-care diagnostics has the potential to actually directly save lives and improve quality of life for the entire population. To me the latter is far more rewarding, and I know that I will work harder and challenge myself more as a researcher when I am personally passionate about the research goal. Working on heart disease diagnostics is especially important and urgent since it is the leading cause of death in the United States—as such, even incremental improvements in quality of diagnostics can result in demonstrable impact as a result of the massive scale. Further, working with UCSF specifically is exciting due to its consistently innovative students and researchers, as well as the high-quality data an institution with the scale of UCSF can provide.",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,"I personally find health-care diagnostics to be the most interesting application of data science currently being explored.

Having done a sharp transition from intended business to data science this past year, I want to jump in and be able to apply my technical skills that I've dedicated myself to.

I've worked internships in industry, and I believe that there isn't as much work passion compared to research. I've always been fascinated by the impact of research and technology. One simple, well-researched idea can rewrite societal structures that have existed inefficiently for decades. To work on an exciting project with like-minded, passionate individuals would be an absolutely enthralling experience.","I've had difficult project and team groups in the past, and these past experiences have led me to believe that a methodical approach is the best approach. Everything in teamwork must be designated and delegated by a team lead. Detailed roles, communication, and trust are the three structures of teamwork that lead to achieving results. If one of these three pillars is not complete, then I believe that it is important to work to fix these issues before moving onward. Communication and trust can lead to productive conflicts that are bound to arise, detailed roles lead to accountability, and accountability makes sure that deadlines are met.",Anomaly detection in Solar Microgrids,"This project is a fascinating intersection of interests for me. I think that solar microgrids are an extremely important step in increasing the reliability of solar energy in our world's current climate state. I also believe that anomaly detection systems are necessary to ensure the safety and monitoring of a product that could have such a widespread implementation. I recently went out of my way to request and complete an anomaly detection project to monitor a data pipeline of real-time TV data, sending notifications of bugs and irregularities in real-time, and this felt like an important and useful tool for my company. I would love to work on more implementations of anomaly detection systems, especially with such a unique project focus as theft detection. Metering systems have been a great source of data, but their exposure to cyber attacks makes the anomaly detection systems extremely important. Regardless, this would be an absolutely awesome project to be a part of. ",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"I'm extremely interested in this project because of the relevancy of this project. Streaming data is becoming and has become a massive part of data science and analytics, especially because when harnessed, there is so much useful data. I currently work with TV streaming data and have worked on commercial deduplication systems and anomaly detection systems. I think that fine tuning parameters for these systems and creating predictions is a difficult but important aspect of analysis, and this would be fascinating to learn about the variety of applications that could be used to approach these problems. Data stream mining, whether the technique be in ML or another application, is a powerful concept, and can have massive impacts on both the entertainment industry and public government institutions. ",NASA data viz,"I think that this is a fascinating project, with so many interesting facets and approaches. Sensors are fascinating because so much data can be produced and analyzed.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,None,Facebook,"I just recently saw the facebook post, so I really rushed to fill out this form in time.

I was in charge of recording classroom logistics: lates and absences, who got called on during class…. With 40 people, 5 classes per day, and 5 days per week, my first taste of the power of data science came when I created bar charts to figure out who the Class Clown was (there were too many candidates to eyeball the result). As I grew up, Data Science expanded into my personal life and interests. In my personal life, I started using Excel to keep accounts and manage my expenses with every receipt, and successfully cut down monthly expenditures by 20%. In my interests, I used Python skills from Data 8 to track student performances and generate reports for my TOEFL, IELTS, SSAT, FCE test prep tutoring and for a class in Anna Yates Elementary in Oakland where I volunteer as a Math teacher. These reports helped greatly with my lesson plans and resulted in 100% pass rate for the 32 students I tutor privately, each with 85%+ out of total score.
Outside Data Science, my biggest interest is learning languages.  As a citizen from Mainland China, I am at the native-speaking level for Mandarin and English, fluent in Spanish and Korean, and Beginner in French. I love language and Data Science for the same reason—they communicate. If language is the highway for communication, and information(data) is the cargo, then Data Science is the vehicle and engine to carry it forward.","I wish to know more about the specific field of the research project, and push myself from being the multi-lingual communicator to also being part of the discovery process by learning from my mentor and peers. More importantly, I wish to use my knowledge, time, and energy at meaningful places. The Discovery Research fulfills my wish because it creates meaningful, long-lasting value that will benefit society in the long run— in terms of education, medicine, humanities, technology and more. ","I am equally comfortable in working independently on a team.  In BCSSA, I had the opportunity to do both independent and team projects, and I really enjoyed the variety. My last project was working on an event planning team for a non-profit organization. I enjoyed brainstorming our approaches and establishing our deadlines and individual responsibilities before going off to work independently on our assigned tasks. However, I also value independent work and built some alone work time every day, too. When working independently, I think it’s also invaluable to be able to reach out to a team for advice and support, which is why I make sure that I’m available to help other project team members when they need assistance. For the event planning project, our team met as a group in the morning but always took a short break around 2 p.m. to refocus before coming together to end the day. The schedule worked well, and we were able to accomplish both our collective and individual goals.",Pathologists Cancer Alert,"I resonate particularly with the communication aspect of cancer treatment, because I was diagnosed with glioma in high school and went through surgery and radio therapy—during which communication and understanding between different physicians were crucial to my survival. Therefore, I completely understand the importance of having good-quality diagnostic information, and I’m willing to help other cancer patients in the Bay Area by contributing in this research project. At the same time, my biggest interest outside school is languages. So far I am at the native-speaking level for English and Mandarin, fluent in Spanish and Korean, and beginner in French. I believe I can contribute to this project by using not only my knowledge about data science, but also about languages and acoustics.

I was fortunate to grow up with an exposure to underdeveloped and agricultural India where my father worked and it allowed me to build a unique lens to view the world through. Coming to the United States was exploring a world outside the bubble I had lived in all my life. This motivates me every day to explore and learn as much as I can about the world around me and equip myself to bring the best of the world to places like my home which could benefit from it. 

I study Data Science (emphasizing on Computer science classes) and Business Administration with the goal of building a business that can help the communities that I want to impact. In my past two years of college, I went from never having written a line of code to declaring data science as a major and doing internships and research of technical nature. 

My interests are vast and range from artificial intelligence and machine learning in computer science to evolutionary biology and cosmology. 

I have been involved with two research projects at Berkeley - the first was a pedagogy research project that tried to analyze different means of teaching and their effectiveness, the second was with an Astronomy PostDoc student where we were trying to analyze radio waves from the atmosphere to find the possibility of alien communication. 

","To put it quite simply, I want to attempt to use the computational and data science skills that I have gained through classes and experiences in a practical context to solve a tangible problem. 
While classes are a great way to acquire information about technical methods, I have found that practical use of these methods to solve problems is the best way to solidify and incorporate them in my work process.  

I want to be able to work with a team towards a common goal absorbing and learning from them along the way and contributing my own skills to the team and my colleagues. 

Additionally, the projects that are offered this semester - especially the ones I have picked as my first few choices - are phenomenal in that they fall perfectly in my sphere of interest academically and in areas that I want to make some impact in.
","My personal experiences have allowed me to understand the value of varied perspective. I understand that people from different cultures, genders, socio-economic statuses, or geographies can contribute to and look at the same problem from a wide variety of lenses and collaborate to build a sustainable and inclusive solution for it. 

I believe in enthusiastic efficiency and think that teams that work well together are more efficient than a group of strong individual contributors. When working on a team I try to approach the team’s work as a project that I have a stake in and try to get to know my teammates well in order to ensure the project’s success. I enjoy bouncing ideas off of teammates and collaborating and learning from others with different opinions.
",LBNL - Streaming data analysis,"This past summer I worked as a software engineer intern at Visa in the Cybersecurity org. It was my first and sudden real world exposure to a gigantic stream of real-time data that was quadratically growing. Over the course of the summer, I learnt several technologies that I could use to deal with the massive data stream and build a cybersecurity application that parsed and detected anomalies in this data. I felt very amazed by the big data applications of the simple program I wrote. I want to delve deeper into streaming data and apply the tools I am comfortable with and learn even more tools that I can apply on streaming data. It has been a childhood dream of mine to work at Berkeley Lawrence National Labs and it was one of the reasons I applied to college here. I was waiting for a project that would be a good fit for me and I have finally found one where the ratio of what I can contribute and what I can gain won't be too skewed for it to be impractical to add me to the team.",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"All my academic as well as career interests are powered by the personal need to make an impact in the said sphere. As a victim of cyberbullying when I was in high school, I know that this is a space that definitely needs work because cyberbullying extends not only in the confines of preteens in school but also in a national context against whole communities of people. I am equipped with not only the personal empathy needed in this project but also a wide variety of technical skills including machine learning and now artificial intelligence skills that I think would help going into this project. I am interested to work with a team with a varied set of perspectives on this issue and work with them to build a unique solution to this problem. 
When I read the project description it fascinated me because most work in this field works from the other perspective of detecting and removing hate speech rather than promoting inclusive speech. I really love the optimistic approach this project is taking and want to contribute to it to the best of my capacity. ",NASA data viz,"Last semester I worked briefly with Breakthrough Listen to build a visualization tool for radio waves collected from radio telescopes around the world to analyze them to listen for radio contact by extraterrestrial intelligence. I want to transition to work with Ames because this project seems like a better fit for my skills and interests. I am very fascinated by the work NASA does and working for NASA in the future is my long term goal. 
I think my previous experiences have equipped me perfectly for this project. Last summer I worked at Visa's Cybersecurity department where I learnt how to build tools that deal with big data systems in order to analyze and apply them in different contexts. A project I worked on with another intern actually developed a playback tool that we called SLARK - The SUDO Log Activity Replay Kit. I think several of my skills are transferable to this project and I can bring a lot to the table.

Whether it be in my academic research, my extracurricular activities or personal hobbies, I have maintained my desire to learn and always seek the most effective course of action. 

One of my academic interests is in the field of neuroscience and especially how we can implement various imaging techniques to understand the brain. Through my research, I have used modern imaging techniques, such as MRI and PET, to better understand Alzheimer’s Disease and how it progresses. By studying the proteins involved and how they accumulate in normal aging, I hope to provide further insight how these proteins may go awry in AD. In embarking on my research, I’ve had to learn new methodologies of pre-processing the imaging data and of visualizing the data, which I’ve enjoyed immensely.

My extracurricular leadership positions also have allowed me to solve problems that have a meaningful impact on the Berkeley community. As the VP of Communications of a tutoring organization for Berkeley Community College, I saw a lack of collaboration between their students. Through implementing group-based discussion sections, as opposed to typical one-on-one sessions, I was able to instill a spirit of teamwork between students that ultimately helped the students achieve more.

Furthermore, my photography hobby has served not only as a creative outlet, but also as another way to continually learn. One of my favorite aspects about photography is the editing aspect that comes after taking the picture. Editing allows me to entirely change the mood of a photo simply by altering lighting and colors. To edit, I learned Lightroom and Photoshop to fully achieve the types of edits I wanted to implement.

I am driven by my desire to learn and solve problems and this drive has led me to my academic and extracurricular interests.
","The Data Science Discovery Research Program is the perfect opportunity to explore the intersection between life sciences, healthcare and Data Science. With many of the projects, they present the unique chance to utilize data science techniques to positively impact society, especially in healthcare. With the classes in Computer Science and Data Science, I have come to realize how powerful data can be in solving difficult problems. I truly believe the most impactful insights into the medical field will stem from the collaboration of traditional research techniques with data science techniques. My past research has mostly been focused in the field of clinical neuroscience and has followed mostly traditional approaches towards neuroimaging. I would love the chance to explore using data science techniques to answer some of the modern-day healthcare challenges we face in a different field, which is a specialty of the Discovery Research Program.

Furthermore, the amazing opportunity to learn cutting-edge data science techniques in healthcare research from leaders in the field has drawn me to the program. Oftentimes, the data science techniques covered in class are geared towards non-healthcare-related fields. The Discovery Research Program has projects that specifically emphasize the healthcare aspect.

In addition, I would love to meet other like-minded Cal students who are also passionate about this intersection of the life sciences and data science. Through past research and class projects, I realized how much I enjoy collaborating with others. Some of my favorite memories came from working with people on my research. 

The Data Science Discovery Research Program has the unique qualities that would allow me to explore my interests and learn from the best.
","Teamwork is one of the most fundamental aspects in developing a successful team. In my experience, effective teamwork is built upon a few qualities: consistent and open communication, synergy between teammates, respectful progress, and personal pride. From my class projects and research experience, I have developed this approach towards teamwork.

Consistent communication, paired with an environment that rewards questions, is vital to developing a team and leads to productivity. With clear communication, every teammate has a well-defined understanding of the project’s goals and his/her role in the project. This idea has been immensely useful in my research. Through asking questions and not being afraid to ask for help, I was able to save myself countless hours on tasks needed for my project. 

Synergy between teammates, where roles are assigned based on the strengths of the individuals, and personal pride can help the team exceed project goals and timelines through increased efficiency. During the last project of my Data Structures class, we were assigned a group project to develop a world-exploration game. Through working with my partner and using our respective strengths, we were able to submit the project well ahead of the deadline. However, project progress cannot come at the detriment of the individuals of the team and doing so will ultimately hurt the team. The goal should always be to find a win-win situation for any challenges.

Whenever I’m a part of a team, I always strive for these qualities, since they are what I would love in a prospective teammate.
",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"Cardiovascular disease is a pervasive disease, especially in the U.S, and presents a challenging healthcare problem that could have vast implications on patients. Due to how widespread cardiovascular disease is, the impact of this project could be massive.

I have always been interested in the intersection of research and healthcare and I geared my past neuroimaging research towards that interest. My past research has helped me develop a methodical and analytical mindset towards solving problems. It has also increased my curiosity in solving clinical problems and working towards projects that could have a direct effect on the patient, which is perfectly exemplified by this project.

Yet, ever since I was introduced to data science in my junior year, especially the power and insight of data science techniques, I have always wanted to explore this new avenue and how data could be used in a research context to solve challenging healthcare issues. This project emphasizes the intersection between data science, research and healthcare, which is exactly what I would love to pursue as a career in the future. I see the potential for the use of large patient datasets in this project to help improve cardiovascular disease patient outcomes. 

Furthermore, the opportunity to learn and implement data science techniques from the renowned researchers at UCSF is incredible. I hope to get a better understanding of the cutting-edge techniques being used in the healthcare field and hopefully continue to use these tools in the future. With how much data is now being collected, the prospective influence of analyzing this data is immense.
",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,"This project interests me because I see the potential of the project to answer a critical problem in the gastroenterology/inflammatory bowel disease field. The results of the project could directly affect patient outcomes and could not only save patient lives, but also have financial implications. 

I have always been interested in the intersection of research and healthcare and I geared my past neuroimaging research towards that interest. My past research has helped me develop a methodical and analytical mindset towards solving problems, in addition to helping me learn relevant statistical techniques necessary for analyzing data. It has also increased my curiosity in solving clinical problems and working towards projects that could have a direct effect on the patient, which is perfectly exemplified by this project.

Yet, ever since I was introduced to data science in my junior year, especially the power and insight of data science techniques, I have always wanted to explore this new avenue and how data could be used in a research context to solve challenging healthcare issues. This project emphasizes the intersection between data science, research and healthcare, which is exactly what I would love to pursue as a career in the future. Since the cost of running randomized trials is high, the opportunity to use data science to answer this question seems to be cost-effective and efficient. 

Furthermore, the opportunity to learn and implement data science techniques from the renowned researchers at UCSF is incredible. I hope to get a better understanding of the cutting-edge techniques being used in the healthcare field and hopefully continue to use these tools in the future.

In Data 8, I wrapped my head around topics covering the intersection of computer science and statistics, and how the application of simple concepts could lead to conclusions from a previous jumble of data.

One of my major academic interests lays in researching molecular-level workings. I interned at Stanford University and gained exposure to wet lab techniques and learned about gene mapping of oncogenic cell lines. For the past year, I’ve worked in UC Berkeley’s Gong Lab, studying cataracts and other pathologies in mutant mouse models.

While I quite enjoy microscopic mechanisms in biology, I’m also interested in larger-scale phenomena that enter the public health sphere. I’m majoring in Public Health because I want to better understand how public health efforts can be effected to improve communities.

Much of this serves as the basis for my interest in the intersection of data and computer science with human health, and is why I am minoring in Data Science. My overarching goal is to discover the possibilities surrounding how data science can be leveraged to amplify my knowledge in public health and molecular bio to ultimately improve our communities.","I’ve taken public health, computer science, data science, and biology courses that have given me tools such as Python, R, SQL, and an understanding of probability and statistical methods, among others. The projects I’ve developed have encompassed real-world topics, but I’m itching to use my knowledge not just to complete problem sets where answers are doled through keys, and where every question has a predetermined answer.

Much of my interest lays in charting the uncharted, which I’ve partially done through molecular biology research. However, I’m applying to the Data Science Discovery research because, if I can take a step further and learn to handle the masses of information at my fingertips, I’ll have a much more powerful skillset in processing data, identifying patterns, and making conclusions — something molecular research hasn’t offered. The ability to manipulate and classify data, see patterns, and ultimately make decisions are essential parts of public health and bio research, which is a major motivational force for wanting to participate in Discovery Research.","I’m a club officer for MEDLIFE and help facilitate our Decal where I, along with ~10 other officers, lead a class of 30+ students. This semester-long production requires the collective efforts of all of the board, the interns that work under us, and the students in our club and Decal.

Through trial and error, I’ve discovered that one of the best approaches to ensuring tasks are completed on time is to identify everyone’s strengths, divvy up the work according to those areas, and have periodic check-ins to make sure progress is being made.

One issue I’ve encountered as part of this leadership group is that it can be easy to fall behind when there is only a single, seemingly distant deadline. To tackle this, I believe an essential component of teamwork is to keep each other accountable for progress. For instance, I have an intern working under me, and we have weekly meetings where we discuss what we’ve accomplished, what we are hoping to accomplish, and what we can change. This approach keeps us on track and on the same page. Additionally, when my intern communicated her obstacles and I was more open to changing our schedule, we were better able to solve our problems together as a team and form a better rapport. Overall, serving as an officer has taught me the importance of adaptability, communication, and keeping each other in check.",UCSF - Meta-analysis of individual participant data from clinical trials of Crohn's Disease,"My background in molecular cell bio and public health serve as the basis for my interest in researching methods to improve the quality of human health. I’d love to help with this project because its goal of developing a better understanding of Crohn's, a human disease, aligns with my academic interests in the biology, public health, and data science, and I believe it has huge implications on improving the quality of lives through upstream prevention.

Analyzing patient data to determine the most effective disease treatments has the potential to save many lives, which is why I am particularly interested in this project. In addition to data science concepts, I also have experience in using precise data collection and manipulation with Excel and R, which I would love to utilize in this research.

I’d love to help with this project because its goal of developing a method to detect heart disease aligns with my academic interests in both the biological sciences and data science, and I believe it has huge implications on improving the quality of lives through upstream prevention.

I previously worked at a startup that used human-scribed medical notes to “teach” the AI to produce its own. I found the idea fascinating that, in the near future, a program could occupy a historically human-run job — and perhaps even do a better job at it. This project is similar in that aspect, and I’d love to discover more about this burgeoning field.

With data science, I found a way to apply my programming knowledge to learn more about the world around me, and also develop my interest in graphics and visualizing data in a creative yet practical way. Another one of my biggest passions is CS education; I’ve been teaching CS for almost as long as I’ve been learning it. As a member of Berkeley ANova, I go to under-resourced middle and high schools in the Berkeley/Oakland area to mentor students and help them explore computer science as well as offer them guidance on other aspects of their life such as college applications. I also lead the organization of a hackathon for beginner high schoolers from these under-resourced schools to give them the opportunity to build a project they’re passionate about and get first-hand experience with the wide range of fields that computer science can be used in. Outside of school, I enjoy exploring nature, especially through hiking; I love the chance to get away from city life and appreciate the small things.","After taking Data 8, I decided to take on a data science double major, as I really enjoyed being able to take large amounts of unreadable and unorganized data and writing code to draw insights and make the information more clear and succinct. I hope that through Discovery Research, I have a chance to apply these skills I learned in class to real-life projects with a desire to help others, by providing a resource or raising awareness. Being able to work on a project I’m passionate about would be an amazing opportunity to not only gain some experience but to learn new skills, work with a team of people who also care about a similar topic, and learn from people who have worked or done research in this field.","To me, the most important factor in teamwork is communication. Especially on a team where everyone is working toward a project they care about, it’s important to maintain strong communication to ensure everyone knows what they’re working on, what the goal is, what the deadline is, and what their plan to complete their task is. When the team is working together on something, it’s important to allow everyone to voice their opinions and then compromise and combine ideas so everyone is happy with the end result.",Exploring the Achievement Gap in Berkeley Public Schools:,"Through my student organization, I go to under-resourced Berkeley public middle and high schools every week to teach computer science.

Throughout high school and into my first semester at Cal, I was CERTAIN I knew what I wanted to study: biology. I KNEW I would major in a biology-related field. I was so SURE that I never really took the time to explore other options. In my freshman year, I immediately applied to a lab studying the neurological pathways involved with sleep in mice. Under this lab, I enjoyed learning to solder implants and perform cryosections. 

In my second semester of freshman year, I decided to take CS61A because I thought, “Hey, why not?” College is the time to explore, or so everyone has been telling me! Surprise: I ended absolutely falling in love with programming. I loved the ability to create a project by myself and to watch it work. I love the struggle of trying to figure out how programming works, of how to make a piece of code run; I love the satisfaction when I finally, FINALLY, debug a particularly stubborn project. Most of all, I enjoyed the challenge of my programming classes. 

Despite having to prior experience in CS, I decided to change my goal to Computer Science: over the summer, I took CS61BL; this past semester, I took CS70. My GPA for these three classes is 3.8, and I have submitted the form to declare Computer Science. In the future, I hope to find biological applications for computer science technologies.
","From my experiences in Dan Lab and my programming classes, I have realized that I want to work on practical, hands-on projects. I am very much a kinesthetic learner, and participating in Discovery Research will provide me with a unique opportunity to understand how the skills I will be learning in Data 8 this semester can be applied to the real world. Discovery Research will also give me a unique insight into the field of Data Science, a field which I am extremely curious to learn more about. 

Additionally, I enjoy learning about various topics for the simple joy of learning. For example, over this winter break, I contacted a hardware engineer at Monolithics Power Systems and set up a chance to learn more about his role through an externship. I ultimately learned a great deal through this experience, despite being more interested in software development. After the externship, I created a Google Slides Presentation about Analog to Digital Converters, a topic with which, as a student who has yet to take EE16A, I had zero familiarity. Nevertheless, the topic was fascinating, and I was excited to organize what I had learned into a format that anyone who started with as little experience as I had would be able to understand.

","My approach to teamwork can be summed up in one word: communication. In order to function, a team must set and communicate goals and deadlines. In order to fulfill its deadlines, a team must delegate and communicate tasks. An expectation of clear communication sets the implicit expectation that each member of a team be organized and ready to communicate with the rest of their team. Therefore, I strongly believe that communication is, above all else, the key to a highly functioning team. 

One example of my approach to teamwork is the process by which RA duty shifts are delegated. Usually, each RA selects a certain day of the week to be on duty. However, if an RA has a conflict (such as a midterm), that RA will take this time to ask to trade shifts with another RA. This expectation of communication requires that all RAs be organized and aware of their own schedule; after all, each RA must be aware of future conflicts when they agree to take a shift. 

After shifts are agreed upon, we communicate to our supervisor which days each RA will be on duty through an electronic form. When on duty, we are required to check in with our supervisor by 7:30PM. This clear communication ensures that no dorm will be without an RA on Duty. Communication holds each RA accountable for performing their duties properly. 

On a team, communication holds each team member accountable for completing project expectations. As such, if selected for a Discovery Research position, I will continue to communicate clearly and efficiently with my team to ensure that our project will meet our deadlines. 
",Making Cyberspace Inclusive: Developing Inclusive Online Speech Detector,"As a Resident Assistant, I understand the importance of promoting an atmosphere of inclusion. A huge part of my responsibilities is to foster a community on my floor. I hope to participate in this project because I agree with the basis of this project: after all, it is not enough that we eliminate hate speech and bias; silent exclusion is just as harmful. Moreover, I am curious about the process for developing a speech detector that can detect not just the simple keywords that denote hate speech and bias, but a more abstract concept of inclusion. I am excited to learn more about what will be considered as a marker of inclusion, as well as to offer my own experiences to help with this project. Lastly, because I am a Residential Assistant with direct access to a community of students new to the environment at Cal, I believe I will be able to use this position to more directly understand and communicate the needs and experiences of this community to support with this project. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"I have always been interested in biology, and I hope to pursue a career that uses technological applications to biology. During my freshman year, I was heavily involved in a role in Yang Dan's Lab, where I worked with my postdoc to study the neurological pathways involved in sleep circuits in mice by introducing lipopolysaccharide, a protein found in the cell wall of bacteria. Through my experience in this lab, I familiarized myself with research techniques such as with various research techniques such as cryosectioning, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy, image analysis, soldering implants, and PCR. I hope to work on detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data because of my past fascination and involvement with biology-related research.

I am a very outgoing and encouraging student who loves to make new friends, talk to different people, and learn new stuff. I decided to come to the U.S. for high school when I was a Freshmen because I want to have a better environment to explore my interests and find my passions. 

I love to learn about different disciplines from online resources, such as different educational Youtube Channels and Khan Academy. I think learning from online resources is a very efficient and convenient way to learn about different things everywhere and anytime. I love to learn about the economy, statistics, sociology, chemistry, and history through online resources, and most of the videos do excellent jobs in explaining and summarizing knowledge. These online classes allow me to make the best use of my fragmentary time and explore my interests.

Furthermore, influenced by my Economics 2 professor, Kristina Rommer, I love to read lots of academic research paper, especially the data-driven ones. I think reading academic journals and research is the best way to dive deeply into a specific area, or topic, of my interests. For example, I love to read the statistical analysis of the research about Monertory policies and the Financial Crisis and Social Psychology. Reading these research papers not only allows me to learn more about specific topics of different disciplines but also helps be master in using statistical tools and basic mathematical modeling.

I have done three academic research since my senior year of high school. 
The first one is the Signal Optimization research. I researched with a professor from Beihang University in Beijing. Due to my interest in Amutre Radio Direction Finding, I was eager to build my radio device that is more stable in detecting the direction and strength of radio signals under extreme weather and terrains. My research involves revising both the physical and hardware component of my radio device. By using basic chip microcomputer and integrated circuit, I was able to improve my device's accuracy by 30% under extreme terrains and lighten the weight by 15%. 

The second one is the Factory Assembly Line Optimization project with a professor from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. In the project, I collected data from factories in Shenzhen, China, and put them into an algorithm that optimizes factories' production efficiency. I learned to program in SQL and Python in the research and had a basic knowledge of computer science in the summer before college. 

The third one is research on renewable energy in China with a Berkeley professor, Daniel Kammen. The research is about transferring SQL data in the SWITCH model into Python models. My job was to analyze SQL data, filtering out unnecessary and repeated data. Also, I debugged and refined lots of errors that occur when professor Kammen transferred his code from Java to Python with my knowledge from CS61A and Data 8. ","First, I want to apply my knowledge in data science, statistics, and computer science in some of the real-life cases. I think this is the best way to learn and master in my skills. What I wish to gain from this research is a better skill in data science both from applying my knowledge and learning from my teammates or partner. Furthermore, I expect to learn more skills that I would never learn in Data 8 and 100, which are more practical in industries and research. By exposing myself more to data science application, I wish to become more sensitive in numbers and data and learn to apply the correct method on specific scenarios. Also, I want to enforce my CS skills by working on Data Science research because I want to be able to apply my CS61A and CS61B skills in learning data science.

Second, I want to learn more about specific industries or academic disciplines through the projects provided by the program. I think using a semester to work on a  project will definitely give me a comprehensive understanding of its corresponding industry. Learning about industries through data science research will not only allow me to find out the specific direction I want to study for my majors but also will enable me to explore my future career interests and personal goals. Moreover, doing data science research will also allow me to learn some research skills and habits, which will be very important for applying to future research.

Third, I wish to know more people in the program. I always evaluate my friends to be one of the essential parts of my life. The people I am going to meet will share similar interests in data science with me, and they could potentially become my life-long friends or college mentors. I want to work with my teammates and enjoy learning and having fun together. I also want to be able to know about the way they think from different perspectives, which will help me to look at research from different angles and enable me to think better. What's more, since most of my teammates will probably be interested in data-science related activities and opportunities, I will be able to gather lots of information for my future academic and career development. ","Have beeing doing research and finance internship, I am confident with my experience in team working and communication. I am usually an organizer in my group, who loves to take notes for every group meetings, set up timelines for projects, and create a group chat for more efficiency. Therefore, I like to hear more rather than speak a lot. I highly value everyone's ability in my group, and I consider everyone's decision comprehensively before rejecting or proposing my own opinions. If I have a conflict with my teammate, I am always the one who makes peace first and re-consider mine and my teammate's opinions when we are both happy again. 

Furthermore, I am also a very active member of a team. I think group bondings is very, very important for any organizations. If I have the honor to join one of the research team, I will always gather my teammates for dinner after work or go to play sports together. This will help me understand my teammates better, which will increase our working efficiency. ",Geometric and Manifold Learning on Graphs and Unstructured Data,"Being able to apply ML to different fields has always been my dream since the beginning of my CS career. I consider this project as an excellent way for me to learn about some of the most cutting-edge topics in Machine Learning. I am very interested in working with an image with programming and hope to convert those images into useful sources for the machine learning model. I think this project fits perfectly with my needs, and I will be able to learn a lot about using unstructured data in the process. Further, I believe to refine and developing Python package will provide me with a great chance to learning about package development, and I will be able to apply my knowledge from my CS classes to this project.

In terms of technical skills, I believe I will be able to make a good contribution to the project. For instance, CS61A gives me a good knowledge of how packages work in Python, and CS61B gives me good exposure to different kinds of data structure and software engineering. ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"Being able to apply AI into different fields has always been my dream since the beginning of my CS career. I think this project will provide me with great exposure to a wide range of fields via data collection and analysis. For instance, being able to detect heart disease, I have to learn about some key features of patients who have heart disease, and I have to be able to translate those features into analyzable data, such as numeric data, graphic data, and waveform data. Specifically, translate electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and medial records into data that can be applied to existing AI models. I found translating different objects into data particular interested because translating data requires a good knowledge of the task that I am working on and I truly want to learn about how AI can be applied to the medical world.

Secondly, the reason why I choose this project among all the other medical-related data science projects is because of this particular disease: heart disease. As an international student from China, a place where has a high population of heart disease, I truly want to learn more about the disease itself and being able to contribute to the research and development of the war against heart disease. I think what this project is aiming for fits with my personal values and, if I have the honor of joining the team, I will seek every learning opportunity.

Lastly, I think my skills fit perfectly with this project. Having taken classes from Data Science, Statistics, and Computer Science, I am good at analyzing all kinds of data, such as geographic data, numeric data, and text data. I am also familiar with using all kinds of data-analyzing packages and conduction hypothesis tests. For instance, to improve the AI model for detecting heart disease, I could apply my knowledge of the nearest-classifier to analyze data. Plus, two of my previous research experiences give me a solid knowledge of the process of doing research, such as data collection, data cleaning, and writing reports. I learned to effectively structure and organize data and information to maximize research efficiency.  ",Dispatcher algorithm,"Since my freshman year, I have always considered Kiwi to be a part of my campus life. As a future entrepreneur, I also admire the amount of influence and the values Kiwi brings to society. I really want to join this project because I consider this as a wonderful opportunity to improve my programming skills as well as to learn more about how a Start-up works. Kiwi might look as simple as a robot that delivers food to different parts of campus, but could be as hard as considering all kinds of data, such as real-time graphical data for a robot to move in the right path, geographical data to minimize the amounts of hills it climbs, and also the battery consumption data to maximizing the working time of each robot. The complexity of the data is what interests me the most. Being able to work with these data will be a great chance for me to learn and contribute to Kiwi. Also, consider that there is a human part of the Kiwi delivery, I also want to help Kiwi to optimize its algorithm so that it can hire as less human as possible to minimize its cost. 

Secondly, the task itself fits perfectly with my interests. I have always wanted to work with moving robots and maps, and Kiwi is obviously a perfect combination of my goals. If I have the honor to work with Kiwi, I will love to create an algorithm that can save the amount of cost of the company and accomplish high delivering efficiency. 

Lastly, I consider my skill set to be a good fit for this project. I was a programmer in my robotics team, so I am familiar with how to use programming to accomplish different goals. With that knowledge in mind, I can make better and faster decisions when collecting necessary data to optimize Kiwi's algorithm. Plus, as a runner, I am very familiar with the geography of our campus. Specifically, I can clearly remember all the downhills and uphills of our campus and even some fast track of our campus. This knowledge can be used as a supplement for optimizing  Kiwi's algorithm. In terms of technical skills, I have taken a good range of classes at Berkeley that train me to use programming packages, coding, and analyzing data sets. My two research experiences also provide me with good behavior of organizing data and utilizing data in different programming languages. I am super excited to apply this knowledge to optimize Kiwi's robots, and I hope I will make great contributions to a company that I admire!

Growing up, my dad took me to the gym countless times so that I could improve my shooting and get in better shape.  From him, I learned that success is achieved through discipline and consistency, and this is a mindset that I have carried with me in my pursuit of becoming a better student, son, friend, and person. 
In turn, basketball has taken me all over the world, as I had the opportunity to play in goodwill games in both Japan and Nicaragua during high school.  Through these trips, I was introduced to different people, cultures, and traditions, and I was exposed to several concerns that affected people internationally, such as homelessness, hunger, and safety.
I am a third-year undergraduate studying Data Science and Bioengineering. Due to the diversity in my coursework, I have an open-minded approach to problem-solving, and I am able to communicate with people across multiple domains.  I am curious about finding solutions to various worldwide issues, such as improving healthcare access, mitigating food deserts, and combatting climate change.  I am passionate about using data science techniques to implement creative solutions that can improve peoples’ lives.  ","When I arrived at UC Berkeley, I pursued the bioengineering major because it seemed to combine my critical thinking abilities with my end-goal of helping others.  However, as I explored courses in other departments, I developed a passion for data science, and I realized that it perfectly combined my problem-solving aptitude with my interest in having an impact on the world around me.  Because I declared the data science major later on in my undergraduate career, most of my exposure to the field has been through my academics.  I would like to participate in Discovery Research because I would like to learn more about real-world implementations of data science, and I would love to contribute to the creation of new knowledge and new innovation.  Through Discovery Research, I wish to gain experience in the field of data science that complements and extends my classroom knowledge, further explore my career interests, and increase my confidence in my abilities.  I am eager to learn as much as possible from the faculty and graduate-level researchers that I will be working with, and I am excited to contribute my motivation and work ethic towards any team that I am a part of.  ","My approach to teamwork revolves around honesty, respectful communication, collaboration, and sacrifice for the greater good of the group.  From the start, I believe that it is essential for a team to establish a goal.  This forces all members to buy in to the common goal, and in doing so, members come to agreement that they will forgo their individual agendas if it means the group will succeed.  A loose plan of action is important because it gives the team a framework to work off of, but at the same time, it encourages individuals to take reasonable risks along the way if they think it can help the team as a whole. Along the way, honest and respectful communication are critical because it allows each member to feel comfortable sharing their ideas and opinions, yet it facilitates vulnerability, in that group members are open to constructive criticism.  Lastly, I believe that great teamwork requires collaboration.  Each person must understand what role they play, and how their skills can contribute to the greater good of the group.  Through collaboration, the team can achieve more than the sum of its parts.
Through Discovery Research, I hope to work collaboratively with faculty, mentors, and other students.  I respect the thoughts and opinions of others, and I while I hope to enhance my knowledge and skills throughout the research process, I will put the team success before my individual agenda.  ",Detecting heart disease with cardiac sensor data,"While cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, it also remains quite preventable.  Therefore, I would like to work on this project because I believe that improving detection and prevention methods will save many lives that are normally lost.  As a double major in data science and bioengineering, I believe that this project combines my passions and compliments my skillsets well in that it uses data science techniques in a medial setting to improve and save lives.  Due to my diverse coursework, I can bring a unique perspective to this project, as well as biological specific knowledge that I can use to make informed decisions throughout the project lifecycle.  
There is an emerging potential for applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve clinical care, and I believe that this project can make significant strides towards integrating new technologies into clinical settings for improved care.
Through this project, I would love to learn more about this complex relationship between traditional detection and AI-based decision making.  In the future, I believe that data science will be used to aid healthcare quality worldwide.  This project would allow me to simultaneously explore my passion for data science in medical settings, as well as explore potential future career options.  ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"
I would like to participate in this project because I would like to learn more about the political and cultural elements surrounding the cannabis market in the U.S.  Even since cannabis has been legalized in several countries across the U.S., I have been perplexed by the lingering stigma around cannabis usage.  Despite legalization, cannabis has not been as widely accepted as alcohol has.  However, the cannabis market has tremendous growth potential, and I would love to learn more about this exciting new market through this project.  As a double major in data science and bioengineering, I can bring a unique perspective to this project, as well as biological specific knowledge that I can use to make informed decisions throughout the project lifecycle.
As cannabis becomes more integrated into American society, it becomes more and more important for the general public to become more educated about its available forms, and its effects.  Through this project, I would love to leverage my programming skills and my knowledge of feature engineering and predictive analysis towards towards positively impacting society through providing informative information surrounding cannabis.  If selected for this project, I will bring a curiosity and excitement to learn, as well as a constant drive to produce new insights.",UCSF - Text Classification on Clinical Notes,"Because of the vast size of the pharmaceutical market in the U.S. in both medical care and over-the-counter settings, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of these drugs on certain diseases.

","Although I have had opportunities to apply the skills I've learned in the classroom during several summer internships, I have always wanted to break away from the corporate context and explore a research question that I am personally invested in. Being a part of the Discovery Research Program would give me the chance to work with some of the brightest minds in the field as well as other students who are passionate about data science like I am. Beyond simply adding another project to my resume, I highly value the experience of a quality learning process, and that is something that I hope and do believe I would receive from participating in the Discovery Research program.  ","Teamwork is undoubtedly an essential component to completing a project, especially a team-led research project. I believe that it is key to have consistent transparency between team members and a commitment to be responsive and engaged when discussing how to move the research forward. To function efficiently, members must be committed to reaching deadlines, but they should also show flexibility and have grace on one another when inevitable life circumstances come up. And fundamentally, there must be mutual respect for one another.

However, while taking Data 8 I started to learn about what data science has to offer, a term I knew of as some sort of buzzword prior. I slowly started to like the subject more and more, and now I intend to double major in business and data science, subjects derived from my love of numbers ever since I was a kid playing with my toy ATM and computing all sorts of simple calculations between deposits and withdrawals. Outside of academics, I am interested in all sorts of activities like watching a range of YouTube videos from tech all the way to competitive eating, and I'm always keeping up on sports like football and tennis. I also enjoy traveling and learning about the various cultures present in society and what the world has to offer outside of my knowledge.","After taking Data 8 and getting insight into the world of data science, I realized not only about the relevance of the subject but also how interesting it truly is. In Data 8, I was able to learn these applications of computational reasoning and statistics to make conclusions on data seen all around me, and it widened my scope of the power of some numbers and categories on a chart. Through Discovery Research, I hope to extend past the given data of smoking mothers and their babies' weights I had in the course and gather conclusions for myself. Those that have no pre-determined answers and instead it is up to me to push the boundaries and explore what can be done. I believe this will teach me immensely about working with others to address critical topics issues while learning more about the applications of coding languages in society. ","Working in a team, I used to always be the one in the back who just went along with what others were saying. Even if I had things to say, I would just be too shy to speak, which has made the biggest difference in my leadership style now. Working on a team, I try my best to incorporate the ideas of all members and make sure everyone’s voice is heard, because I know the bigger the group the greater the ideas and impact that the group can have. All it takes is for everyone to be incorporated as a cohesive unit, and I strive to be that helping hand to those who may need one.  ",NASA data viz,"I've simply been really interested in airplanes and flying for a while, and this project seems like a great opportunity for me to extend my knowledge and see how data can be transformed to analyze behaviors and their associations with other categories within the set. This project can further be used to help pilots see links that they never knew were present and in turn possibly help them out in the flying process as well, which is understandably very important in using the data we have to better the society in which we live in. ",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"As one who is interested in the intersection of business and data science, I find this project extremely fascinating given the ability to understand the cannabis market and elements on it that affect competition. Since the cannabis market has been growing ever so quickly and been heavily influenced by the government and cultural aspects, it will be interesting to see how exactly the market has changed in a reaction to these causes and in turn be able to see for the future how the industry is projected to react. This project will truly allow me to visualize how data can help understand business in ways I had never seen prior. ",Examining the spaces of violence against youth experiencing homelessness,"I believe that this subject of violence against youth is an extremely important subject and one that needs to be focused on given the widespread homelessness that is present in society today. It's imperative to not look away from societal problems but instead tackle them through the knowledge we have; that's why I really find it interesting to work with others and understand differing views to solve problems and make decisions in the data conversion aspect of this project which can in turn make an effect on crucial matters. It is ever so important that efforts can be made to see what is currently going on and then find solutions to mitigate these problems, even if it's through the help of providing data. It's great to see a project have applications in the real world, but its even better when those applications can make a positive impact in the lives of others.

After my dismissal I was very lost in my identity and ability to perform academically and so I decided to wait a while before pursuing academics again. In that time, I worked part time at a dry cleaner and as a high school tutor. In the beginning of 2019, I finally felt confident to go back to school and took community college classes to transfer back into UC Berkeley. This will be my first semester back in three years. I understand that I am coming from a nontraditional background, but because of it I want to work diligently and really soak up whatever knowledge UC Berkeley has for me. In terms of academic interests, I am excited to learn more about the world of computer science but also how it can be used creatively. Other than computer science, I do get a certain joy in teaching. I think a part of it comes naturally to me because I can empathize with students and try my best to see things in their perspective. I am considering exploring that field as well.","Through Discovery Research I first and foremost want to gain experience in data science which is a subset in computer science. There is still much for me to learn and I would like to experience as much as I can in my time here at UC Berkeley. I want to be able to analyze data and learn how to determine conclusions from those data sets. I understand that conclusions are formed by gaining different perspectives on the data, but I would like to learn where the line is drawn in terms of data manipulation for the conclusion. I also just want to look at how research is conducted. I have no research background and would love to learn the procedures and simply what research is being conducted in this school. I also want to learn what are the best ways in presenting information so that the most amount of people will be able to understand. Conclusions are useless if no one else can understand them.","To me teamwork is first being able to establish clear communication between all team members. Depending on how much authority I have, I do try to make sure everyone voices their opinion as well as their questions. It is quite easy to feel lost within a team and be unable to bring up concerns. Everyone has a differing perspective and the team benefits so much when everyone is heard. This not only affects a team’s ability to gain new information but also benefits each team member to work harder when they feel like they have been heard. Teamwork is also being able to take responsibility over the team’s achievements and failures. There is a fear to ask questions because questions imply a lack of knowledge and a lack of knowledge can lead to a lot of judgement for the person asking the question. However, a true team should acknowledge, take responsibly, do its best to educate and not ridicule its own members. A team will fall the moment a member selfishly decides to work on his/her own and simply see the other team members as competition. So I approach teamwork with really wanting to establish each member as a full part of the team.",Student Success Analytics Platform,I am a student that was academically dismissed and have a pretty good idea how I got there.

My impeccable plan as a pre-med major was halted when my close friend suggested for me to take a programming class because I appeared so fascinated by all the projects she worked on. I always had an interest in coding but I was always hesitant to venture into the filed because I was hesitant to venture into a field where many had started pursing in their youth whereas I was at the starting line. My introduction to programming was not only full of fascination and intrigue but also of frustration. It was this frustration that fueled my desire to change my major as I realized that there were so much more material and languages that I didn’t know and would not be able to explore if I just stopped at this class. My decision to switch majors has permitted me to enroll in classes that I find truly intriguing. While my entrance into data science is not a traditional approach, I find my decision to be rewarding as I have accumulated so many analytical and programming skills that I wouldn’t have access to if I had not chosen this path. ","By participating in Discovery Research, I hope to put to test my knowledge and skills that I have accumulated through my class and work experience. I love to create things and had admired artistic creations since I was young. Through my participation, I aspire to be apart of the creative process of these purposeful projects and test my ability. I hope my participation in this program can help guide me in the direction I want to proceed towards in my future. ","Through the projects I have completed at university, I have developed the ability to work collaboratively with other individuals. In a team, I like to provide support for my teammates when they require assistance and hope that my teammates would do the same for me.

I’ve always been passionate about higher education and bring innovation to the field with data science. I have the goal of making higher education more accessible through educational platforms, and providing a more personalized learning experience. Through posting educational tutorials, being a teaching assistant, and conducting interviews and surveys with students and teachers, I realized the most difficult issue was to understand the misconceptions of students and to provide appropriate guidance. Specifically as a math tutor, I recognized students' blind spots in math exercises and went through multiple related exercises with students. In addition, enrollment for each class is growing rapidly while only limited space and resources are allocated. Online course platforms together with data analytics have huge potential to offer a better learning experience for a broader audience. Dan Stratford, the product manager of Google for Education, gave a speech about creating a culture of innovation in higher education, which inspired me greatly to pursue a career in data science and education. Recently, I took Data Mining and Analytics from Professor Zachary Pardos. I was extremely excited when he shared his research in ""Deep Learning in Higher Education Big Data to Explore Latent Student Archetypes and Knowledge Profiles"". His idea of monitoring students' reaction to exercises to determine the probability of their understanding of the subject topics impressed and motivated me to apply data science to benefit the educational system.

I love data science because it is a way for me to learn about the world from data using computation. I can visualize certain patterns in data, or use data to draw conclusions or even make predictions! For AI, I began to notice it when Alpha Go appears to beat every human player in Go. As a Go player for 8 years, I knew that AI has been developed to an extent beyond my previous recognition, so I really want to know and explore the algorithms in the AI field. Last summer, I found an internship at HeroTech8 in Berkeley Skydeck which required me to design a user interface for a ground control station that controls unmanned aircraft. There I learned basic Robotics software designs, so I joined in Pioneers in Engineering and RoboMaster@berkeley last semester.
Moreover, I love to play basketball and tennis in my spare time. I joined a singing club because I really love singing. I hope to participate in some singing competition someday.","First, I think it's a good chance for me to learn collaboration. I want to learn how to be part of a research team to study simply for academic purpose. The experience in a research team can mold my personality so that I can learn to be more efficient in teamwork.
Second, studying data science is interesting for me, especially in a team. I used to study Data 8, but I haven't got enough experience in Data Science study yet. Therefore, this research opportunity is really valuable for me.
Moreover, I think Discovery Research can broaden my horizon. I think I can always learn something beyond my imagination.","My approach to teamwork is simple. First, in the first meeting, I would like to divide the whole projects into different tasks, where each individual can know what to do. Then, after the deadline for the first task, the second meeting will be held in order to make sure that everyone understood their own part and make sure all the members are making progress. If someone got stuck, everyone else can help with it. Holding small meetings recently is really important to me, as it's the best way for me to make sure that all the members are on the right track to the goal.
Therefore, my way to teamwork is to fully communicate and collaborate with other members in the group, to make connections with others.",Dispatcher algorithm,"Firstly, I am especially interested in the objects in the study: Kiwi Mate and Robot assignation. Exploring the dispatcher pattern for Kiwi bot is to help with the delivery application in our daily life, which is a lot of fun to me. Therefore, I would like to learn from the historical delivery time, Kiwibot locations, and orders to observe the pattern. It is definitely a good chance for me to get in touch with the real data in our daily life.
Secondly, I am curious about the result of this study. What is the most time-efficient to dispatch Kiwibot? As the data consists of both normal points and noisy points, the way to transform data and utilize it to obtain useful results seems challenging and attractive to me. It requires logical thinking and even creativity to think of an efficient dispatcher algorithm, and that is both what I am interested in and what I am good at.
Moreover, I think of using data visualization to deal with the complicated data set. The projects even might require some kind of machine learning algorithm in order to generate an efficient algorithm, so I can utilize the previous knowledge I knew in this project. Therefore, I really want to join this project!",NASA data viz,"Firstly, this project is innovative for me because investigating the flight behaviors for airline pilots is a study that has practical use for the society. Therefore, the responsibility to contribute to society will stimulate my passion to do this research as I know that my study is really useful.
Secondly, this project in Python is a great fit for me with my previous Python projects in software development in Robotics system and the ground control system for aircraft. Therefore, this project which simulates the condition of a flight will consider eye fixation is challenging and interesting to me.
Moreover, the project takes a lot of logical abilities as it has to take a lot of factors into account such as the time between two events, the frequency of certain behavior patterns. Finding out potential factors and inner connections between factors is my interest and my advantage as well.
Overall, I think this project is a great fit for me and I think I am capable of identifying and analyzing different data types in the study. I am curious about the final result that this research might come out. It will be a wonderful academic experience for me.",Pricing norms in cannabis markets,"Firstly, I am especially interested in the market of cannabis as cannabis is considered a drug in many countries, but it is not banned and generate a special market for it. Therefore, I would like to know and study the principle of the market of cannabis while making clean data set. I hope I can learn how the political element will affect the US cannabis industry.
Secondly, this project requires skills in natural language processing, an area I used to learn in CS 61A. However, although I didn’t dive deep into this area. Processing a large amount of human language data to discover the pattern in cannabis’s product description sounds really attractive and challenging, as a product in the Gray area is complicated in its nature.
Moreover, utilizing data analysis technique to discover the pricing norm of a market is a great pleasure for me. I used to study market patterns in UGBA 10, so I can compare the data analysis and result with the knowledge I learn to observe the uniqueness of the cannabis market.

I was passionate to understand physical phenomenon and grasp the way we can use them to make an impact. Over the course of a few semesters, I slowly realized that to use these phenomena and change lives, physics isn't enough. Computing, design, system level understanding and hardware all come together to create massive systems of change. That's my academic interest. It's bringing together empathy-centered design and real technical skills to have an impact on individual lives. In India, I worked on a roadRescue project where I proposed an Uber based system of providing first-respondence to roadside accidents. At Cal, I'm working on a startup idea with a PhD student to mobilize the blind using echolocation-powered hardware. Over the course of my college career, I want to learn more tools and skills (in Data, computing, and hardware) and work on problems I find worth solving. ","Personally, I'd like to learn how to complete and end-to-end project using data. I realize the power of data in pure analysis but I'd like to understand how we can pair tools like machine learning with real, helpful tools for users. One project that really attracted me (from the Spring 2020 set) is the Automated Water Purification project. To build something like that, especially coming from India where clean water is a massive issue, is very exciting to me! I'd love to learn how to formally build an application and connecting it with the right data. I'd also like to get a chance to put my skills in data science and data structures into play and be able to use them to build something like this application. I really think this experience will kickstart a future in building solutions to large-scale problems.","Teamwork, to me, is based on two fundamental concepts. The first is time management. With a set of tasks at hand, dividing that up fairly and evenly is essential such that work is completed. However, I believe that the process well supersedes the result. In order to get something that is of maximal quality, people need to be enjoying the process. In that sense, getting everyone to do something they enjoy and will want to stay up at night for is essential. The other is simply solid communication. If we can be honest with each other about where we're struggling, what we are doing well, and what we need to do moving forward, I honestly feel like problems become much easier to solve. Communication and honesty lead to clear steps ahead, and as a team, that will allow us to constructively get closer towards our goals for our project. ",Automated Water Purification,"Like I've mentioned earlier, I would love to be able to work on the issue of water quality. In India, I did assessments of water quality data using labs and surveys across New Delhi and Gurgaon. However, I found the use of highly fraudulent data and was disappointed. A project like this one gives me a chance to apply my algorithmic thinking and app-development skills while also using data and analytics to create better system design. At the same time, this could be a step towards finding a way to better measure water quality and assess it. I'd love to eventually finish this project and find a way to then use it in India and make it a national concept, such that we can completely end the presence of dirty water at least throughout major Indian cities. ",Automated reports for city-wide air sensor network,"Once again, India has given me much to see when it comes to the environment. Air pollution is a major problem in New Delhi, India. I've always wondered how the distribution of the particulate matter actually takes place, however. It's an odd physical phenomenon driven by statistical mechanics and the presence of high winds and air currents. To be able to analyze such streams of data in real life (from the data provided) and understand the nature of these distributions would honestly by my internal data-geek's dream come true. It would be amazing to see what type of mathematical models best fit that sort of data, and further, to see whether there is potential to use that data to figure out whether certain regions need to be paid attention to! For example, is there any way we could reduce gas emissions in certain regions where there is a high density of car-traffic? Who knows? Well, the answers to those questions may lie in the data, and I'd be ecstatic to find out. ",Dispatcher algorithm,"Since late last semester, I have found a deep interest in algorithms. It's quite incredible how simplicity in algorithms often allows for efficient and yet complete solutions to problems. Seeing the Kiwi Bot almost once a day has made me realize how inefficient it's delivery often is. It would be a really fun and interesting project to understand what type of algorithms are currently being employed in dispatch, and to further see if there are optimization factors we can add in to make the process more smooth! This project would be an amazing fit for me, additionally because of my interest in data structures and algorithms. While data science is incredible, applying smart structures to hold that data could make a MASSIVE difference on time taken and customer satisfaction.

And so, come time to go to college, I did what anyone in my position would think to do: go to Berkeley and become a math major. 
	I’ve always been enamored by math. The mystery contained in these weird looking symbols has been something that propelled me into the world of this fundamental, logical language that is used to explain nearly everything. Which is exactly what I want to keep using math to do: to find patterns in our complex world and help explain them for the benefit of our understanding. I can find no better field than Data Science to foray into in order to do this.
","I want to get a better picture of how people work with the data science lifecycle in real settings. I want an opportunity to apply the theory I’ve learned through my coursework in a way that can help people in some way or another. Whether that means working on a problem in energy sciences or equitable resource allocation, I wish to use what I know in a real and complex scenario. As a math major with a concentration in data science, I think this will round out my undergraduate experience. I also believe it will give me a firm grasp of how everything I’ve learned relates with one another as well. 
	To sum up, right now I feel like a musician who has only ever played scales their entire career. I want to play a piece of music that showcases my technique and passion.","Unlike many, I would say that I am a big fan of group work. I perform best in classes when I have at least one person to study with and bounce concepts off of while doing homework. My previous experiences in undergraduate research have shown me the value of having other people to collaborate with or ask questions to if I’m having trouble. 
I think that everyone has different ideas and skills that they each bring to a group. To me, the purpose of having a team is to harness all of these skills in order to produce something that one member alone could not. In that vain, my approach to teamwork is to help create a positive, constructive work environment in which everyone feels comfortable presenting their thoughts. I work to avoid situations where I or anyone else would feel uncomfortable asking a question, because that could mean risking an oversight of the problem at hand. Overall, I do the work I’m supposed to do while encouraging other team members to present theirs, with the overall goal of feeling like we all did our part.",Environmental Justice Mapping Project,"I think this project is a great way to make research results more accessible to people in general. I think that we are not lacking in people who work in environmental justice, but I do think that we need a better way to disseminate important information to decision makers across the country so that environmental justice can be ""served"" at a policy level. This project looks like a great way in which do to that. ",Community Air Monitoring Monthly Report,"I've long wanted to give back to the Bay Area through my studies, and this project seems like a great way to do this. I know that places like Richmond have poorer air quality due to, among other factories, its Chevron oil refinery. Being part of a project that meticulously tracks air quality would be a great way for me to help people notice trends in air quality for the sake of advocacy and decision making through data collection.",Assessing Research Usability for Development Practitioners in Southern Africa,"Similar to my interest in my first choice, I think the issue of centralizing climate information for decision makers is an extremely important one.

I like exploring new emerging areas of tech such as VR, AR, fintech among others. In fact, I make it a point to start my day by reading some news articles about new technology and/or things going on in the software space because I believe that keeping up with latest developments is a must in this field as it becomes easier to integrate new ideas into our projects. I interned this summer as a software engineer intern at Netskope (A cloud security company) and worked with DevOps tools like Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes. I also like to read so I've taken a few English classes at Cal like Short Stories by Vikram Chandra(the writer of the famous Sacred Games Netflix series).
I love meeting new people and like to take initiative to lead projects to completion by planning effectively. In my free time, I like to explore new places, catch an improv comedy show or read a good book. ","There is always more to learn and I believe that most learning happens not in the classroom, but while actually working with people on projects that affect us. By participating in the Discovery Research program, I am eager to learn and contribute to society's growth using the knowledge that I have gained so far in my coursework. ","I have realized three things I am really passionate about – making decisions based on evidence and analysis, taking initiative and leading projects to completion via effective planning and organizing resources, and tackling multifaceted problems by working with a diverse group of people. Experience has taught me how to build strong relationships with people around me, and thus besides being able to work well on my own, I tend to work well in a team.

As a Data Science and Business Administration double-major at Cal, I have a strong enthusiasm to learn more about how technology, innovation, and data science can be integrated with business and other fields. I am drawn to the tasks in data analytics which require detailed analytical skills in complement to communicative interactions with other teams and within the team. Gaining professional experiences from different industries from local Japanese businesses, a nonprofit, a startup like Credit Karma, to a well-established corporate like Google, I have learned how to be versatile to different tasks and environments. This exposure also allows me to take unique views on any challenges by taking both detailed and holistic approaches and drive forward innovative solutions. I believe that I will be able to offer these unique perspectives to the table while learning and working on a research project as a part of Discovery Research Program.","Through participating in Discovery Research, I hope to be able to apply data science knowledge I learned from classes in real-life industries, ranging from university research, NGOs, and NPOs to start-ups. Being part of this program will not only further develop my skills, but I will also get to use my knowledge to contribute to the society, through the project I will get an opportunity to work on. I have been in a consulting club since my first semester at Cal where I get to work on solving real-world business problems for my clients utilising different research and data analytics tools. The projects I worked on in the past were more business focused, so I hope to learn and explore the side of data science and its application in different industries.","Living and working with students from 50 countries during my high school years, I realized the potential of collaboration. This engaging environment shaped me into an active learner who is independent of her own thinking but is always willing to collaborate and be open to other perspectives. Through my past experiences working in a team, I learned to be both a good leader and a good listener. I always make sure to communicate effectively, while also give everyone equal opportunity to share their perspectives. At the same time, I learned how to be a good planner. Making short and long term plans and goasl from the beginning of the project definitely helps to guide the team towards the right direction and stay organized throughout the entire project.",Data Visualization for User Experience,"User experience and interface is a field I have always been interested in.

As a student, I feel like I have found more experience as a software engineer and developing full-scale applications. I'm extremely interested in synthetic biology, which is involved in re-designing organisms to make them more useful or to give a particular advantage. One of the most striking ideas I've heard in the realm of synthetic biology is the engineering of biosynthetic pathways and enzymes to improve the efficiency of existing processes of food production, to increase the quality and nutritional value of produced food, and to generate novel food products. As a first-generation Indian in America, I've often heard of the struggles that my grandparents and relatives in the rural parts of India face in regard to agriculture and the potential of synthetic biology in this area astounds me.

I am generally interested in how data science, computer science and software engineering can contribute to synthetic biology as well as medical biology. I want to use what I've learned to help people and I think the applications and implications of data in biology are very interesting. ",I hope to gain more real-world experience in Data Science and learn how to apply the concepts that I learned in data 8 and data 100 to problems and issues faced in the real world.

I've worked on processing and analyzing data that have been collected and then used much later but the shorter timeframes and importance of time as a factor are very intriguing to me. Applications of data science and computer science to finance is also very intriguing to me.

I have recently accepted an SWE position at McKinsey for the coming summer which also hires a large number of data scientists. I believe that this opportunity would allow me to pivot into a data science position as it could provide crucial information and practice in real-time analysis of data that could contribute to problems that business face like risk analysis and making strategically sound data-driven decisions.
